Abstract
This paper deals with the long-term behavior of the solution to the nonlinear stochastic
1
heat equation ∂u
∂t − 2 u = b(u) Ẇ , where b is assumed to be a globally Lipschitz
continuous function and the noise Ẇ is a centered and spatially homogeneous Gaussian
noise that is white in time. We identify a set of nearly optimal conditions on the
initial data, the correlation measure of the noise, and the weight function ρ, which
together guarantee the existence of an invariant measure in the weighted space L 2ρ (Rd ).
In particular, our result covers the parabolic Anderson model (i.e., the case when
b(u) = λu) starting from the Dirac delta measure.

1 Introduction
In this paper, we study the following nonlinear stochastic heat equation (SHE):
⎧
1
⎨ ∂u
(t, x) − u(t, x) = b(x, u(t, x))Ẇ (t, x) x ∈ Rd , t > 0,
∂t
2
⎩u(0, ·) = μ(·).

(1.1)

The noise, Ẇ (t, x), is a centered Gaussian noise that is white in time and homogeneously colored in space defined on a complete probability space (, F, P) with the
natural filtration {Ft }t≥0 generated by the noise. Its covariance structure is given by:
J (ψ, φ):=E [W (ψ) W (φ)] =

Rd

(s, ·))(x),
(dx)(ψ(s, ·) ∗ φ

(1.2)

(x):=φ(−x), “∗”
where ψ and φ are continuous and rapidly decreasing functions, φ
refers to the convolution in the spatial variable, and is a nonnegative and nonnegativedefinite tempered measure on Rd that is commonly referred to as the correlation
measure. The Fourier transform of (in the generalized sense) is also a nonnegative
and nonnegative-definite tempered measure, which is usually called the spectral measure and is denoted by 
f (dξ ) (see (1.21) for the convention of Fourier transform).
Moreover, in the case where has a density f , namely (dx) = f (x)dx, we write

f (dξ ) as 
f (ξ )dξ .
The initial condition, μ, is a deterministic, locally finite, regular, signed Borel
measure that satisfies the following integrability condition at infinity:

Rd


|μ| (dx) exp −a|x|2 < ∞ for all a > 0,

(1.3)

where |μ| = μ+ + μ− and μ = μ+ − μ− refers to the Hahn decomposition of the
measure μ. Initial conditions of this type, introduced in [1] and further explored in [2,
3], are called rough initial conditions.

The function b(x, u) is uniformly bounded in the first variable and Lipschitz continuous in the second variable, i.e., for some constants L b > 0 and L 0 ≥ 0,
|b(x, u)−b(x, v)| ≤ L b |u −v| and |b(x, 0)| ≤ L 0 for all u, v ∈ R and x ∈ Rd . (1.4)
In particular, our assumption allows the linear case b(x, u) = λu, which is usually
referred to as the parabolic Anderson model (PAM) [4].
The SPDE (1.1) is understood in its mild form:
u(t, x) = J0 (t, x; μ) +

b(y, u(s, y))G(t − s, x − y)W (ds, dy), (1.5)

is the solution to the homogeneous equation, and the stochastic integral is the Walsh
integral. We refer the interested readers to [2, 5–7] for more details of this setup.
The aim of this paper is to investigate the conditions required to guarantee the
existence of an invariant measure for the solution to (1.1), which is a crucial step for
the study of the ergodicity of the system that requires the corresponding uniqueness.
We direct the interested readers to [8–10] for more details about the invariant measure,
its existence/uniqueness, and the ergodicity of the system. The general procedure for
finding the invariant measure, especially in the setting of (1.1), has been laid out by
Tessitore and Zabczyk [11], which involves two parts: first one needs to show that the
laws of the solution to (1.1) form a family of Markovian transition functions on some
Hilbert space, H , and the corresponding Markovian semigroup is Feller; and second
one needs to establish that the moments of solution are bounded in time (see (1.8)).
For the second point, it requires some substantial work (see Theorems 1.1 and 1.3).
On the other hand, the first point has been shown to be true for our case of interest (see,
e.g., [10, Chapter 9]) with the following weighted L 2 (Rd ) space as our underlying
Hilbert space as in [11]:
Definition 1.1 ([11]) A function ρ : Rd → R is called an admissible weight function
if it is a strictly positive, bounded, continuous, and L 1 (Rd )-integrable function such
that for all T > 0, there exists a constant Cρ (T ) such that
G(t, ·) ∗ ρ(·) (x) ≤ Cρ (T )ρ(x) for all t ∈ [0, T ] and x ∈ Rd .

(1.7)

Moreover, we denote by L 2ρ (Rd ) the corresponding Hilbert space of ρ-weighted square
integrable functions, and we use ·, · ρ and · ρ to denote the inner product and norm
on L 2ρ (Rd ):

f , g ρ :=

dx f (x)g(x)ρ(x) and

ρ :=

dx | f (x)|2 ρ(x).

Accordingly, we will prove the existence of the invariant measure following the
same strategy as in [11]. Let L (u(t, ·; μ)) denote the law of u(t, ·) starting from μ at
t = 0. We will first establish the tightness of {L (u(t, ·; μ))}t>t0 for some t0 ≥ 0. A
critical step in obtaining this tightness result is to show that the following moment is
uniformly bounded in time (see Theorem 1.3):
sup E
t>0



u(t, ·) 2ρ < ∞.

(1.8)

Then we will apply the Krylov–Bogoliubov theorem (see, e.g., [10, Theorem 11.7]) to
construct an invariant measure via

n→∞ Tn

η(A) = lim

 Tn +t0

dt L (u(t, ·; μ))(A),

(1.9)

for some sequence {Tn }n≥1 with Tn ↑ ∞.
In the literature, the existence of an invariant measure for the stochastic heat equation
is more commonly studied with a drift term; we will postpone a brief review of
this case to Sect. 5.1. In contrast, the existence of an invariant measure under the
setting of equation (1.1) has been much less studied. Tessitore and Zabczyk [11]
established the existence of an invariant measure for the case where the spatial domain
is the whole space Rd , the diffusion term, b(x, u), is globally Lipschitz in the second
variable, uniformly bounded in the first variable (see (1.4)) and there is no additional
negative drift term to help. Recently, in the linear case, that is, the case when b(u) =
λu, Gu and Li [12] established the weak convergence of u(t, ·) to Z (·) in C(Rd )
with Z (·) being a stationary random field. The convergence in [12] relies on the fact
that the initial condition is to be stationary, i.e., μ(dx) = dx; see Remark 3.6 ibid.
for some perturbations that can be made on the constant initial condition. A similar
stationary limit has also been obtained in Dunlap et al [13]. The current paper follows
largely the work by Tessitore and Zabczyk [11]. The major challenge is to identify
the right conditions so that the probability moments of the solution are bounded in
time (see (1.8)). The solution to (1.1) is usually intermittent, namely its moments
possess a certain exponential growth in t, see, e.g., [4, 14]. For that reason, one has to
impose some additional assumptions on the initial conditions, the noise, the coefficients
of (1.1), and the weight function ρ in order to control the growth of the moments in
L 2 (0, ∞); L 2ρ (Rd ) . The point-wise moment formulas obtained in [2, 3] play an
important role in this context.
Here we emphasize that we study the invariant measure using the Walsh random
field approach [7], whereas such studies are mostly carried out under the framework
of the stochastic evolution in Hilbert spaces [10]. Even though both theories are equivalent (see [15]), the differences in many technical aspects are still substantial. As the
random field approach often produces results that are more explicit, we try to use
this approach to obtain more precise conditions for the existence of an invariant measure. Firstly, for the initial conditions, the results in [11] allow for bounded L 2ρ (Rd )
functions, although the authors proved their main result—Theorem 3.3 ibid.—only
for the constant one initial condition. Here we give the precise conditions on the ini-

123

tial condition (see (1.17)), which allows a wider class of data, including unbounded
functions and measures such as the Dirac delta measure (see Examples 5.6 and 5.7).
Note that the Dirac delta initial measure plays a prominent role in the study of the
stochastic heat equation; see, e.g., [16]. Secondly, regarding the noise, we identify the
right conditions, (1.10a) and (1.13), or equivalently (1.19), on the noise to ensure the
existence of an invariant measure. Our conditions are explicit, easy to verify, and in a
compact form (see (1.19)). Although they are not necessary and sufficient conditions,
we believe these conditions are toward to the optimal conditions; see Remark 1.2.
Note that the correlation function in Gu and Li [12] is assumed to be a smooth function with compact support. The comparisons of our conditions with those obtained
by Tessitore and Zabyczyk [11] are given in Sect. 5.2. Thirdly, our proof relies on a
factorization representation for the solution u(t, x) to (1.1) (see Lemma 3.3), which
is obtained under the random field framework, whereas such factorization lemma has
been widely used in the framework of the stochastic evolution equation in Hilbert
spaces; see Sect. 3 for more details. Finally, we point out a miscellany of results in
Sect. 5, which may have independent interest.
Now we are ready to motivate the conditions that we use and present the main
results.
1.1 Main Results
As mentioned earlier, in order to have moments bounded in time as in (1.8), one
should better first identify the sharp conditions under which the second moments as a
function of t, namely t → E u(t, x)2 , with x fixed, are bounded. This question has
been answered in [2, Theorem 1.3 and Lemma 2.5], where necessary and sufficient
conditions are given. More precisely, to have the second moment bounded in time
with x fixed, one needs to have the spatial dimension d ≥ 3, and in addition, the
spectral measure fˆ and Lipschitz constant L b of b(·) need to satisfy the following two
conditions:
ϒ(0):= (2π )−d

interval:

(1.12)

It turns out that besides condition (1.10a) we need one more condition on the spectral
measure 
f , which strengthens Dalang’s condition (1.12) in a different way1 : that for
some α ∈ (0, 1],
ϒα (β):= (2π )−d

(1.13)

In some literature, condition (1.13) is called the strengthened Dalang’s condition.
These three conditions are illustrated in Fig. 1. The subtlety of these conditions is also
illustrated in Example 5.10 and Fig. 5.
Remark 1.1 Dalang’s condition (1.12) assures the existence and uniqueness of an
L 2 ()-continuous solution; see [6]. Moreover, Dalang’s condition alone is sufficient
for the weak sample path comparison principle [3] and the stochastic comparison principle [18, 19]. But Dalang’s condition (1.12) alone is sometimes too weak to derive
some useful properties. Instead, the strengthened Dalang’s condition (1.13) is widely
assumed in the literature. For example, condition (1.13) is used to derive the Hölder
regularity of the solution; see [3, Theorem 1.8] or [20] for the random field approach
1 In [17], the authors constructed a spectral measure 
f such that ϒ(0) < ∞ and ϒα (β) = ∞ for all

α ∈ (0, 1).

and Theorem 2.3 of [21] and Theorem 4.4 of [11] for the infinite-dimensional SDE
approach. One may also check the densely blowup solution obtained in [17] where
Dalang’s condition (1.12) is satisfied but condition (1.13) fails. As another example,
condition (1.13) is also required in order to derive the sample path comparison principle in [3]. As shown in Lemma 3.3, condition (1.13) guarantees a factorization of
the solution, which plays a key role in the tightness argument in the proof of the main
result—Theorem 1.3.
We are now ready to state our two main results of the paper.
Theorem 1.1 Let u(t, x; μ) be the solution to (1.1) starting from μ which satisfies (1.3).
Assume that
(i) ρ : Rd → R+ is a nonnegative L 1 (Rd ) function;
(ii) for all t > 0, the initial condition μ satisfies Gρ (t; |μ|) < ∞ where

Gρ (t; μ):=

Rd

dx J02 (t, x; μ) ρ(x);

(1.14)

(iii) the spectral measure 
f and the Lipschitz constant L b satisfy the two conditions
in (1.10).
Then there exists a unique L 2 ()-continuous solution u(t, x) such that for some
constant C > 0, which does not depend on t, the following holds:

E u(t, ·; μ) 2ρ ≤ CGρ (t; μ∗ ) < ∞, for any t > 0,
(1.15)
where μ∗ :=1 + |μ|.
This theorem will be proved in Sect. 2. We now state and prove a corollary which
shows that the solution to (1.1) starting from an L 2ρ (Rd ) initial condition will almost
surely be in L 2ρ (Rd ) for all t > 0.
Corollary 1.2 Under the same assumptions of Theorem 1.1, if in addition ρ is admissible (see Definition 1.1), then the solution u(t, ·; ζ ) to (1.1) almost surely exists
in L 2ρ (Rd ) for all t > 0, whenever the initial condition is also in L 2ρ (Rd ), i.e.,
ζ ∈ L 2ρ (Rd ).
Proof Choose and fix an arbitrary ζ ∈ L 2ρ (Rd ) and set ζ ∗ = 1 + |ζ |. It is clear that
ζ ∗ ∈ L 2ρ (Rd ). By (ii) of Theorem 1.1, it suffices to show the finiteness of Gρ (t, ; ζ ∗ )
for all t > 0. Indeed, by Hölder’s inequality, Gρ (t, ; ζ ∗ ) is equal to

Now for any t > 0, choose T > t and let Cρ (T ) be as in (1.7). Then,

Since t and T are arbitrary, this completes the proof of the corollary.

Theorem 1.3 Let u(t, x) be the solution to (1.1) starting from μ and let ρ be an
admissible weight function. Assume that
(i) there exists another admissible weight ρ̃ such that

Rd

ρ(x)
dx < ∞;
ρ̃(x)

(1.16)

(ii) the weight function ρ̃ and the initial condition satisfy the following condition:
lim sup Gρ̃ (t; |μ|) < ∞;

(1.17)

t>0

(iii) the spectral measure 
f and the Lipschitz constant L b satisfy the two conditions
in (1.10);
f satisfies the
(iv) for some α ∈ 27 ϒ(0)L 2b , 1 (see (1.11)), the spectral measure 
strengthened Dalang’s condition (1.13).
Then, we have that
(a) for any τ > 0, the sequence of laws of {Lu(t, ·; μ)}t≥τ is tight, i.e., for any
 ∈ (0, 1), there exists a compact set K ⊂ L 2ρ (Rd ) such that
L u(t, ·; μ)(K) ≥ 1 − ,

for all t ≥ τ > 0;

(1.18)

(b) there exists an invariant measure for the laws {Lu(t, ·; μ)}t>0 in L 2ρ (Rd ).
This theorem will be proved in Sect. 4.
Remark 1.2 The conditions on the spectral measure 
f for the existence of an invariant
measure are given by conditions (iii) and (iv) of Theorem 1.3, which can be summarized
in the following more compact form (thanks to Lemma 3.4):

(1.19)

Even though condition (1.19) is not the necessary and sufficient condition for the
existence of an invariant measure, it is almost the optimal condition. In particular,
as proved in [2], if ϒ(0) = ∞, namely condition (iii) of Theorem 1.3 fails, then no
matter how small the level of the noise is, the solution is always intermittent, i.e., the
second moment Lyapunov exponent of the solution is always strictly positive. Note
that intermittency is another way to characterize the chaotic behavior of the underlying
system that is far from equilibrium.

1.2 Outline and Notation
The paper is organized as follows: we first prove Theorem 1.1 in Sect. 2. Then in
Sect. 3, we study the factorization lemma and explore the relations of various conditions on the spectral measure 
f . Then, we proceed to prove Theorem 1.3 in Sect. 4.
Finally, in Sect. 5 we make some further discussion on the main results and present
various examples. In particular, in Sect. 5.1, we give a brief review of the problem of
finding invariant measures for the SHE with a drift term; in Sect. 5.2, we compare our
conditions on the spectral density with those obtained by Tessitore and Zabczyk [11];
in Sect. 5.3, we show that our results could include a wider class of initial conditions;
in Sect. 5.4, we carry out some explicit computations for the Bessel and related kernels as the correlation functions; finally, in Sect. 5.5, we give a few examples of the
admissible weight functions.
We conclude this Introduction by introducing some notation and formulas that
we use throughout the paper. We will use X p to denote the L p () norm, namely
X p = (E(|X | p ))1/ p . We will also use the following factorization property of the
heat kernel,
G(t, x)G(s, y) = G

ts sx + t y
,
t +s t +s

G (t + s, x − y) ,

(1.20)

which can be easily verified and has been used extensively and critically in [1–3].
Next, we will need the following spherical coordinate integration formula:

Rd

dx f (|x|) = σ (Sd−1 )

 ∞

dr f (r )r d−1 ,

0

where σ (Sd−1 ) = 2π d/2 / (d/2) and (x) denotes the Gamma function. We use
“∼” to denote the standard asymptotic equivalent relation. Lastly, the convention of
Fourier transform is given by (see Remark 5.1)
(ξ ) = Fφ(ξ ):=

2 Moment Estimates: Proof of Theorem 1.1
We first state some known results and prove a moment bound in Corollary 2.3.
Theorem 2.1 (Theorem 1.2 of [3]) Suppose that
(i) the initial deterministic measure μ satisfies (1.3);
(ii) the spectral measure 
f satisfies Dalang’s condition (1.12),
Then, (1.1) has a unique random field solution starting from μ. Moreover, the solution
is L 2 () continuous and is adapted to the filtration {Ft }t≥0 .

Theorem 2.2 (Theorem 1.7 of [3]) Under the assumptions of Theorem 2.1, for any

which the function H ((t; γ p ) is bounded in t. Therefore, by taking into account the
expression of γ p in Theorem 2.2, we see that as a direct consequence of (2.1), whenever

Remark 2.2 (Restarted SHE) Recall that the Markov property of the solution to (1.1)
implies that for any t ≥ t0 > 0,
L

u(t + t0 , x; μ) = u (t, x; u (t0 , ·; μ)) =:v(t, x),

(2.5)

where L refers to the equality in law. Then, v satisfies the following restarted SPDE:
⎧

Under the conditions in (1.10), Theorem 2.2 and (2.5) imply immediately that
v(t, x) q = u(t + t0 , x; μ) q ≤ Cq 1 + (G(t + t0 , ·) ∗ |μ|)(x)
= Cq J0 (t + t0 , x; μ∗ ),
for all q ≥ 2 and t > 0, where the constant Cq does not depend on t. Moreover, under
the assumptions of Theorem 1.1, we have v(0, ·) ∈ L 2ρ (Rd ) a.s. and

3 A Factorization Lemma and Various Conditions on Spectral
Measure
3.1 A Factorization Lemma
In this part, we establish a factorization lemma with corresponding moment estimates;
see Lemmas 3.2 and 3.3. This factorization lemma appeared in [23]; check also Section 5.3.1 of [10]. For α ∈ (0, 1), t > 0 and x ∈ Rd , define formally

(3.2)

For Fα , the first step of the proof of [11, Theorem 3.1] showed the following
proposition:
Proposition 3.1 Let ρ and ρ̃ be given as in condition (i) of Theorem 1.3 (see (1.16)).
For any q > 2, t0 > 0 and α ∈ (q −1 , 2−1 ), the operator Fα , as an operator from
L q (0, t0 ); L ρ̃2 (Rd ) to L 2ρ (Rd ), is compact.
As for Yα , we have the following two lemmas, which hold for both the non-restarted
SHE (t0 = 0) and the restarted SHE (t0 > 0). We need first introduce some notation.
Recall that Dalang’s condition (1.12) can be strengthened condition (1.13), which can
be further strengthened to
ϒα (0):= (2π )−d



fˆ(dξ )
< ∞ for some α ∈ (0, 1].
2(1−α)
Rd |ξ |

(3.3)

We will also need the following slightly different condition:
Hα/2 (t) < ∞ for some α ∈ [0, 1) and for all t > 0,

(3.4)

where
Hα (t):=

 t
dr r
0

−2α


Rd

fˆ(dξ ) exp(−r |ξ |2 ).

(3.5)

The quantity Hα (t) will appear naturally in the proof of Lemma 3.2. We use the convention that when α = 0, we simply drop it from ϒα (β) and Hα/2 (t), i.e., ϒ(β):=ϒ0 (β)
and H(t):=H0 (t).
Lemma 3.2 Suppose that μ—the initial condition for u—satisfies (1.3) and that 
f
satisfies Dalang’s condition (1.12). Suppose that for some α ∈ (0, 1/2), Hα (t) defined
in (3.5) is finite for all t > 0. Fix an arbitrary t0 ≥ 0. Let v(t, x) be the solution to the
restarted SHE (2.6) and Ẇt0 be the time-shifted noise (see (2.7)) when t0 > 0 and let
v = u when t0 = 0. Then,
Yv (s, y):= [Yα b (◦, v(·, ◦))] (s, y)

Journal of Theoretical Probability

where we remind the reader that μ∗ :=1 + |μ| and the function H (t; γ ) is defined
in (3.5);
(2) under conditions in (1.10), if Hα (t) is finite for some α ∈ 64L 2b ϒ(0), 1/2 ,
then for any q with 1/q ∈ 64L 2b ϒ(0), α , the function H t; 32q L 2b in (3.7) is
uniformly bounded in t ≥ 0, i.e., supt≥0 H t; 32q L 2b < ∞;
(3) under conditions in (1.10), if Hα (t) is finite for some α ∈ 64L 2b ϒ(0), 1/2 ,
then for any q with 1/q ∈ 64L 2b ϒ(0), α and for any nonnegative and L 1 (Rd )function ρ, there exists a constant  =  (q, L b , L 0 , α), which does not depend
on t, such that for t > 0,

(3.9)

Remark 3.1 Condition (3.9) is true for t0 > 0 because Gρ (t; μ) is a continuous function
for t > 0 and Hα (s) is continuous and bounded for s ∈ [0, t] thanks to (3.5). However,
when t0 = 0, the situation is much trickier. For example, when the initial condition is
the delta initial condition, we have that


dx G(t, x)2 ρ(x) = G(2t, 0)
dx G(t/2, x)ρ(x) < ∞,
Gρ̃ (t; δ0 ) =
Rd

Rd

where one can obtain the second equality via (1.20). Hence, when s → 0, Gρ̃ (s; δ0 )
blows up with a rate s −d/2 . Considering that Hα (s) goes to zero with a different rate,
one needs to combine these two rates to check if condition (3.9) holds. By introducing
t0 and restarting the heat equation, one can avoid this issue, that being the potential
singularity of Gρ̃ at s = 0.
Proof In the proof, we use C to denote a generic constant that may change its value
at each appearance. We first prove (3.7). By the Burkholder–Davis–Gundy inequality
and Minkowski’s integral inequality, we see that

Note that for the Lipschitz condition in (1.4), we have that
|b (x, v)| ≤ |b (x, v) − b (x, 0)| + |b (x, 0)|
≤ L b |v| + L 0 ≤ C(1 + |v|), C:=L b ∨ L 0 .
We apply this and the moment bound (2.1) to b(z i , v(r , z i )) q above to see that

Plugging the above expression to the far right-hand side of (3.12) proves (3.8). Finally,
the finiteness of the upper bound in (3.8) is guaranteed by condition (3.9). This completes the proof of Lemma 3.2.

3.2 Relations of Various Conditions on Spectral Measure
The relations of various conditions on the spectral measure 
f are illustrated in Fig. 2;
see Lemma 3.4 for the proof:
If we denote the first row of four conditions in Fig. 2 by (a1 ), (a2 ), (a3 ) and (a4 ), and
those in the second row by (b1 ), (b2 ), (b3 ) and (b4 ). The implications (bi ) ⇒ (ai ) with
i = 1, . . . , 4 are clear. It remains to show the four equivalent relations. In particular,
part (i) of Lemma 3.4 proves the bottom two equivalences in Fig. 2, i.e., (b1 ) ⇔ (b2 )
and (b3 ) ⇔ (b4 ). The top two, i.e., (a1 ) ⇔ (a2 ) and (a3 ) ⇔ (a4 ), are covered by part
(ii) of Lemma 3.4.
Remark 3.2 By Lemma 3.4, if one assumes (1.10a), which is the case for Theorem 1.3,
then all the right four conditions in Fig. 2 are equivalent.
Lemma 3.4 For all α ∈ [0, 1), we have the following properties:

According to Assumption (i), we can choose and fix some admissible weight function ρ̃ such that (1.16) is satisfied. Hence, by Proposition 4.1, the following set
K1 ():=



G(t0 , ·) ∗ y(·) (x) :


y ρ̃ ≤  with  > 0

is relatively compact in L 2ρ (Rd ).
Assumption (iii), i.e., (1.10), implies that the interval 64L 2b ϒ(0), 1/2 is not empty.
Moreover, Assumption (iv), i.e., (3.3), guarantees that there exists a constant α in this
interval, namely 64L 2b ϒ(0) < α < 1/2, such that (3.3) holds with α replaced by 2α,
i.e., ϒ2α (0) < ∞. Now we can apply part (3) of Lemma 3.4, thanks to (1.10a), to see
that ϒ2α (0) < ∞ if and only if (3.5) holds. Therefore, both Lemmas 3.2 and 3.3 (more
precisely part (3) of Lemma 3.2) are applicable. In particular, Lemma 3.3 ensures that
the following factorization is well-defined:

5 Discussion and Examples
5.1 Invariant Measures for SHE with a Drift Term
In this part, we give a brief account of the case when the SHE has a drift term which
plays a crucial role in controlling the moments. The equation usually takes the following form:
1
∂
−  u(t, x) = g(x, u(t, x)) + b(x, u(t, x))Ẇ (t, x) x ∈ O, t > 0. (5.1)
∂t
2
The references in this part are far from being complete. The interested readers can find
more references from the references below.
The first case is when the drift term g(·) in (5.1) satisfies certain dissipativity
conditions, which push the solution toward zero, see, e.g., [8, 26–29]. Such a “negative”
drift term helps to cancel the growth of the moments. Here is one example of such
drift term: for some m, ki , ci > 0 as |u| → ∞:


g(u) ≤ −k1 |u|m + k2 u > 0,
u < 0.
g(u) ≥ c1 |u|m − c2

Journal of Theoretical Probability

In particular, Cerrai [8, 28] and Brzeźniak and Ga̧tarek [27] considered the case of
a bounded spatial domain, while Assing and Manthey [26] and Eckmann and Hairer
[29] considered the whole space Rd . Note that Eckmann and Hairer [29] studied the
additive noise case along with a bounded initial condition.
Several works that do not require an added drift term with dissipativity as in (5.2)
include Misiats et al [30, 31]. In Theorem 1.2 of [31], they provide a result guaranteeing
the existence of an invariant measure for the stochastic heat equation on the whole
space Rd . More precisely, they allow for a drift term, g(x, u) : Rd × R → R, such
that for all x ∈ Rd and u 1 , u 2 ∈ R,
|g(x, 0)| ≤ ϕ(x)

|g(x, u 1 ) − g(x, u 2 )| ≤ Lϕ(x)|u 1 − u 2 |,

and

√
for some L > 0 where ϕ(x) must decay fast enough such that ϕ/ ρ ∈ L 2 (Rd ) ∩
L ∞ (Rd ) and ρ is the admissible weight. Thus, f ≡ 0 is allowed. However, they
require the following condition on the diffusion term b:
|b(x, u 1 ) − b(x, u 2 )| ≤ Lϕ(x)|u 1 − u 2 |,
which excludes the parabolic Anderson model. Lastly, Theorem 1.2 ibid. requires the
initial condition to be in L 2 (Rd ), which excludes the two important cases, u(0, x) = 1
and u(0, ·) = δ0 (·). Our Theorem 1.3 includes both of these initial conditions; see
Sect. 5.3.
5.2 The Conditions for Spectral Measures by Tessitore and Zabczyk
Tessitore and Zabczyk [11] established the existence of an invariant measure for (1.1)
in L 2ρ (Rd ) under the assumptions that (1) there exists a ϕ ∈ L 2ρ (Rd ) ∩ L 2ρ(Rd ) where
ρ/
ρ ∈ L 1 (Rd ) and the solution starting from ϕ is bounded in probability in L 2ρ(Rd )
and (2) that the spectral density fˆ satisfies

f ∈ L p (Rd )

for some p ∈ [1, d/(d − 2)) ;

(5.3)

see part (i) of Hypothesis 2.1 ibid. However, as was illustrated in Theorem 3.3 ibid.,
in order to apply this theorem to a specific initial condition in L 2ρ (or to have moments
uniformly bounded in time), the following additional assumptions were imposed:
d ≥ 3 and
L −2
b >


f | ∗ |F

(5.4)

where the convention of the Fourier transform is given in Remark 5.1. With these
assumptions, they were able to prove that (1.1) starting from the constant one initial
condition satisfies (1.8) and thus is bounded in probability, verifying the existence of
an invariant measure via the construction (1.9).

Remark 5.1 The Fourier transform may be defined differently depending on how
one handles the 2π constant. In this paper (as in [2, 3]), we use the convention

sponds to (2π )−d/2 
takes into account this difference, therefore explaining the slightly different factor in
front of the integral in (5.4) from that in (3.4) ibid.
Our condition (1.10a) should be compared with the second condition in (5.4). We
will explain below why the former is more natural, easier to verify, and weaker than
the latter.
The square root and absolute value in (5.4) make their condition more restrictive.

Now set f (x) = (g ∗ g) (x) = 2−2 max(2 − |x|, 0). It is clear that f is nonnegative.
It is also nonnegative-definite because 
f (ξ ) = 

Up to a constant, one may replace F by F −1 . The following example shows that

The next example illustrates the delicacy of choosing the right branches for the
square root in (5.4).
Example 5.4 Let f and g be given as Example 5.1. In this case, 
f (·) is only nonnegative (not strictly positive) with infinitely many zeros. Hence, when taking the square
root of 
f (ξ ) as in (5.4), one needs to wisely select the correct positive and negative
branches: (1) Clearly, the signed version 
f (ξ ) = ξ −1 sin(ξ ) is preferable since its
inverse Fourier transform can be easily computed, which is equal to g(x). Moreover,
because this inverse Fourier transform g(x) is nonnegative, the absolute value signs
in (5.4) do not pose any additional restrictions. (2) However, if one chooses the posif (ξ ) = |ξ −1 sin(ξ )|, then it is not clear how to compute its
tive branches, namely, 
Fourier transform. In general, some bad choices of the positive/negative branches may
f (ξ ) into a
make the conditions in (5.4) fail. For example, such choice may turn 
distribution, and then taking the absolute value of a distribution (unless it is a measure)
f (ξ ) is a well-defined
may be problematic. Another issue that may arise is when 
function, taking on both positive and negative values and after taking the absolute
value, the integral in (5.4) may blow up.
5.3 Various Initial Conditions
In this part, we give some concrete examples of initial conditions.
Example 5.5 (Bounded initial condition) We emphasize that if the initial condition,
μ, is deterministic and is such that μ(dx) = ϕ(x)dx with ϕ ∈ L ∞ (Rd ), then all
conditions related to Gρ (·) in both Theorems 1.1 and 1.3 are trivially satisfied. To be
more precise, both Conditions (1.14) and (1.17) hold because
Gρ (t; |ϕ|) ≤ ϕ 2L ∞ (Rd ) ρ L 1 (Rd ) < ∞ uniformly for all t ≥ 0.
Example 5.6 (Delta initial condition) In this example, we study the case when the initial
condition, μ, is the Dirac delta measure at zero, namely δ0 . Let ρ be a nonnegative
L 1 (Rd ) function. Since

Gρ (t; |δ0 |) =
dx G(t, x)2 ρ(x) ≤ G(t, 0)2 ρ L 1 (Rd ) , for all t > 0,
Rd

both conditions (1.14) and (1.17) are satisfied. In particular, lim supt>0 Gρ (t; δ0 ) = 0.

123

Journal of Theoretical Probability

Example 5.7 (More initial conditions not in the weighted L 2 space) In this example,
we study the case when μ(dx) = |x|−α dx for some α ∈ (0, d). It is clear that when
α ∈ (d/2, d), μ ∈
/ L 2ρ (Rd ). However, in this case, we have
J0 (t, x) = G(t, ·) ∗ |·|−α (x) ≤ G(t, ·) ∗ |·|−α (0).

Gρ t; |·|−α ≤

Therefore, we see that both conditions (1.14) and (1.17) are satisfied.
The following proposition shows that for initial conditions with unbounded tails,
condition (1.14) may hold while condition (1.17) may fail.
Proposition 5.1 Suppose that ρ(x) = exp(−|x|), which is an admissible weight function. Let the initial condition μ be given as μ(dx) = |x|α dx with α > 0. Then for
some constants C, C  > 0 that depend on d and α, it holds that
C  (1 + t α ) ≤ Gρ (t; |μ|) ≤ C(1 + t α ),

for all t > 0.

(5.6)

In particular, this implies that condition (1.14) is satisfied, but condition (1.17) fails.

((1 + r )/2)2α ; when 2α ≥ 1, we have used the super-additivity of x 2α : namely, that

Note that one can use (5.8) as the definition of the Bessel kernel. Properties 1 and
4 ensure that f s is a nonnegative and nonnegative-definite tempered measure for all
s > 0.
Example 5.9 (Matérn class of correlation functions) The Matérn class of correlation
functions has been widely used in spatial statistics; one may check the recent work
[33] for references. Following Section 2.10 of [34], this class of correlation functions
is given by:
K (x) = φ · (α|x|)ν Kν (α|x|) , for x ∈ Rd with φ > 0, α > 0, ν > 0,

(5.9)

where Kν (·) is the modified Bessel function of second type, and α and ν refer to the
scaling and smoothness parameters, respectively. From the inversion formula (see p.
46 ibid.), one sees that, for all ξ ∈ Rd ,

123

F K (ξ ) = (2π )d F −1 K (ξ ) = (2π )d f (|ξ |) with
f (ξ ) =

2ν−1 φ (ν + d/2) α 2ν
π d/2 α 2 + |ξ |2

ν+d/2

.

Comparing the above expression with (5.8), we see that the class of Bessel kernels f s ,
with s > d − 2 and d ≥ 3, includes the Matérn class (5.9) as a special case under the
following choice of parameters:
α = 1, ν = (s − d)/2, and φ = 2(2−d−s)/2 π −d/2 (s/2)−1 .
Note that the requirement of the smoothness parameter ν > 0 for the Matérn class
corresponds to the case of the Bessel kernel with s > d.
The following proposition shows what conditions (3.3), (1.10a), and (3.4) reduce
to for the Bessel kernel as the correlation function in terms of its parameters.
Proposition 5.2 (Bessel kernel as correlation function) If the correlation function f
is given by the Bessel kernel f s (·) with s > 0 defined in Example 5.8, then

ϒ(0) =

Then integrating the right-hand side of the above expressions against π d/2 r −2α dr over
[0, t] gives the five cases in (5.13). This completes the proof of Proposition 5.2. 

Similarly, one can use the Bessel kernel as the spectral density. In this case, we
have the following proposition:
Proposition 5.3 (Bessel kernel as spectral density) Suppose that the spectral density

f is given by the Bessel kernel f s (·) defined in Example 5.8 (see (5.8)), or in other
−s/2
words, suppose that the correlation function f (x) is given by f (x) = 1 + |x|2
for s > 0. Then
ϒα (0) =

(1 − α) (α − 1 + s/2)
22d π 3d/2 (d/2) (s/2)

for all s ∧ d > 2(1 − α) > 0,

(5.15)

and in particular when α = 0, (5.15) simplifies to the following:
ϒ(0) =

21−2d π −3d/2
(s − 2) (d/2)

for all s ∧ d > 2.

The necessity of the finiteness of ϒ(0) excludes the Riesz kernel as a choice for
the spectral density. However, we can still construct a Riesz-type kernel which has
polynomial growth at the origin and polynomial decay at infinity, but with different
rates, using Propositions 5.2 and 5.3. This Riesz-type kernel gives another example
of a kernel that is easily verifiable to be permissible under the conditions of our
Theorem 1.3, while being demanding to verify using (5.4); see Example 5.10 for more
details.
Example 5.10 (Riesz-type kernel) For s1 , s2 ∈ (0, d), let f s1 and f s2 be Bessel kernels
as in Example 5.8. Define
r (x):= f s1 (x) + 
f s2 (x) or equivalently 
r (ξ ):= 
f s1 (x) + f s2 (x).
It is easy to see that r (·) is both nonnegative and nonnegative-definite which follows
immediately from the linearity of the Fourier transform and the fact that the Bessel
kernel is both nonnegative and nonnegative-definite. Also, we easily deduce from
properties (2)–(4) in Example 5.8 that


|x|s1 −d |x| → 0,
r (x) ∼
|x|−s2 |x| → ∞,


and 
r (ξ ) ∼

|ξ |s2 −d |ξ | → 0,
|ξ |−s1 |ξ | → ∞.

Propositions 5.2 and 5.3 imply that

In contrast, it is not clear how to compute F 

and three strengthened versions in (1.10a) (i.e., ϒ(0) < ∞), (1.13) (i.e., ϒα (β) < ∞),
and (3.3) (i.e., ϒα (0) < ∞).
5.5 Examples of Admissible Weight Functions
In this part, we give some examples of the admissible weight functions. As given in
Section 2 of [11], the following functions are admissible functions:


ρ(x) = exp(−a|x|) a > 0,
ρ(x) = (1 + |x|a )−1 a > d.

(5.22)

The smaller the weight function ρ(·) (not necessarily admissible) is, the larger the
space L 2ρ (Rd ) is. For example, one may choose ρ to be either a nonnegative function
with compact support or the heat kernel itself G(1, ·). In both cases, ρ is smaller than

123

Journal of Theoretical Probability

those in (5.22) (up to a constant). However, one can easily check that the admissible
condition (1.7) excludes these two cases. However, the examples in Proposition 5.4
seem to be less obvious:
Proposition 5.4 ρb (·) is admissible if and only if b ∈ (0, 1] where

ρb (x):= exp −|x|b , x ∈ Rd , with b > 0.
Proof From Definition 1.1, we see that ρb is admissible if and only if for all T > 0,

Denote the above integral by I (t, x). We will use C to denote a generic constant that
does not depend on (t, x), which value may change at each occurrence.
We first assume that b ∈ (0, 1]. In this case,
|x|b = |x − y + y|b ≤ (|x − y| + |y|)b ≤ |x − y|b + |y|b .
Hence,

I (t, x) ≤ C

Next we assume that b > 1. We need to show that ρb is not admissible. Without
loss of generality, we assume that d ≥ 2. The case when d = 1 is easier and can be
proved similarly as the proof below. It suffices to show that
lim I (1/2, xr ) = ∞, where xr := (r , 0, · · · , 0) ∈ Rd .

r →∞

Without loss of generality, we may assume that r $ 2. Denote y = (y1 , · · · , yd ) =
(y1 , y∗ ) with y∗ ∈ Rd−1 . Using the subadditivity (resp. convexity) of (x + y)b/2 when
b ∈ (1, 2] (resp. b > 2), we see that

for some ξ ∈ [r − y, r ]. Since b − 1 ∈ (0, 1], this implies that r b−1 − (r − y)b−1 ≥

Another application of the intermediate value theorem shows that r b − (r − 1)b =
bξ b−1 with ξ ∈ [r − 1, r ]. Hence, r b − (r − 1)b ≥ b(r − 1)b−1 and then

K  (r ) ≥ Cr b−2 exp b(r − 1)b−1 .
Hence, for r $ 2, K  (r ) is positive and unbounded as r → ∞. Therefore, this implies
that K (r ) blows up as r → ∞, which completes the proof of Proposition 5.4.
