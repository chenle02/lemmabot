Abstract
We consider nonlinear parabolic stochastic PDEs on a bounded Lipschitz domain
driven by a Gaussian noise that is white in time and colored in space, with Dirichlet or
Neumann boundary condition. We establish existence, uniqueness and moment bounds
of the random field solution under measure-valued initial data ν. We also study the
two-point correlation function of the solution and obtain explicit upper and lower
bounds. For C 1,α -domains with Dirichlet condition, the initial data ν is not required
to be a finite measure and the moment bounds can be improved under the weaker
condition that the leading eigenfunction of the differential operator is integrable with
respect to |ν|. As an application, we show that the solution is fully intermittent for
sufficiently high level λ of noise under the Dirichlet condition, and for all λ > 0 under
the Neumann condition.

1 Introduction and main results
In this paper, we study nonlinear parabolic stochastic partial differential equations
(SPDEs) on a bounded Lipschitz domain U in Rd . By a domain we refer to a connected
open subset of Rd . Consider a second-order differential operator

where [ai j (x)]i, j is a real-valued symmetric matrix that is Hölder continuous on U

where |ξ | := ξ12 + · · · + ξd2 . We consider operators of the form (1.1) because our
approach in this paper is based on heat kernel estimates for operators in divergence
form (see Sect. 3.3 below). We consider the following SPDE with (vanishing) Dirichlet
boundary condition:

x ∈ U,
⎪
⎩
u(t, x) = 0,
t > 0, x ∈ ∂U ,

(1.3)

as well as the same equation with (vanishing) Neumann boundary condition:
⎧

⎨ ∂t u(t, x) + L u(t, x) = λ σ (t, x, u(t, x)) Ẇ (t, x), t > 0, x ∈ U ,

(1.4)

where n is the outward normal to the boundary ∂U of U .
We make the following assumption on the noise and correlation function:
Assumption 1.1 The noise Ẇ is a centered and spatially homogeneous Gaussian noise
that is white in time with the covariance given by
E Ẇ (t, x)Ẇ (s, y) = δ(t − s) f (x − y),

(1.5)

where δ is the delta function and f is a nonnegative and nonnegative definite function
on Rd . We assume that there exist constants 0 < C f < ∞ and 0 < β < 2 ∧ d such
that
−β
≤ f (x − y) ≤ C f |x − y|−β
for all x, y ∈ U .
(1.6)
C −1
f |x − y|

1509

For example, f may be taken as the Riesz kernel f (x − y) = |x − y|−β . In both
Eqs. (1.3) and (1.4), λ > 0 is a constant parameter representing the level or intensity
of the noise.
We need some regularity and cone conditions on the diffusion coefficient σ , which
is given by the following assumption:
Assumption 1.2 We assume that σ : (0, ∞)×U ×R → R in both Eqs. (1.3) and (1.4)
is a non-random function such that σ (t, x, 0) = 0 for all (t, x) ∈ (t, ∞) × U and
there exists a constant L σ > 0 such that
|σ (t, x, u) − σ (t, x, v)| ≤ L σ |u − v|

for all t > 0, x ∈ U and u, v ∈ R. (1.7)

In particular, Assumption 1.2 implies that
|σ (t, x, u)| ≤ L σ |u|

for all t > 0, x ∈ U and u, v ∈ R.

(1.8)

Besides, we will need the other side of condition (1.8) in order to derive some lower
bounds later: there exists a constant lσ > 0 such that
σ (t, x, u) ≥ lσ |u|

for all t > 0, x ∈ U and u ∈ R.

(1.9)

Our results will also cover the important case—the parabolic Anderson model (PAM)
[5]:
σ (t, x, u) = u
for all t > 0, x ∈ U and u ∈ R.
(1.10)
In this case, our results hold with L σ = lσ = 1.
We assume that the initial condition ν is a non-random, locally finite, signed Borel
measure on U . Denote |ν| := ν+ + ν− , where μ = μ+ − μ− is the corresponding Jordan decomposition of μ with μ± being two nonnegative Borel measures with disjoint
support. The exact blow-up rate of the locally finite measure near the boundary will
be controlled via an integrability condition by the leading eigenfunction; see (1.14).
Initial conditions of this type will be called rough initial conditions. An important
example is the Dirac delta measure, which plays an important role in the studying the
long-time asymptotics of the solution; see, e.g., [1] and [16].
For stochastic heat equations on Rd , the probabilistic moment bounds and the
two-point correlation function, both under rough initial conditions, have been studied
in [7–10, 14]. As for bounded domains, Foondun and Nualart [24] considered the
stochastic heat equation on an interval (0, L) with space-time white noise and either
Dirichlet or Neumann boundary condition, and studied the moments and intermittency
properties of the solutions. Nualart [33] and Guerngar and Nane [26] extended the
results in [24] to fractional stochastic heat equations with colored noise, but only to
the case when the domain is the unit ball in Rd plus a Dirichlet boundary condition. In
all these works [24, 26, 33], the initial conditions are assumed to be a bounded function.
Important initial data, such as the Dirac delta measure, have not been properly studied.
One of the main objectives/contributions of this paper is to study the moments and
correlation function of the solution of parabolic SPDEs (1.3) and (1.4) under rough
initial conditions with a uniformly elliptic operator L on a bounded domain U ⊂ Rd .

is a typical example of the non-Lipschitz domain where there is a cusp

For the parabolic Anderson model (i.e., σ (t, x, u) = u) on Rd , Chen and Kim [14]
have shown that the two-point correlation function can be expressed as

(1.11)
for some kernel function K; see also [9] for the space-time white noise case with d = 1.
Under the conditions (1.8) and (1.9) for σ , the correlation function also admits upper
and lower bounds of the same form as the right-hand side of (1.11). By establishing
sharp upper and lower bounds for the kernel K, one can then obtain sharp bounds for the
correlation function. The formula (1.11) is established in [14] by using a convolutiontype operator . It is natural to ask if one can obtain similar formula and bounds for the
correlation function in the case of bounded domains. The convolution-type operator
on a bounded domain U ⊂ Rd has been considered by Candil in [4], where this
operator is used to study the localization error between the solution of the stochastic
heat equation on U and the solution of the same equation on Rd .
In [33], it is mentioned that the extension of the moment estimates from the unit
ball—a smooth, convex and bounded domain—to other bounded domains is not
straightforward. One may expect that some geometric and regularity conditions on
the domain would be required. The majority of our results below work for a general
Lipschitz domain (see examples in Fig. 1(1.1–1.4). Convexity of the domain will be
only required for the lower bounds of the moments in case of the Neumann boundary
conditions. Domains with more regularity than the Lipschitz condition on the domain,
such as the C 1,α -domain (α > 0), will allow us to obtain sharper upper moment
bounds under Dirichlet boundary condition. See Table 2 below for a summary of our
results.
For the Neumann boundary condition, there have not been many results except
those in [22, 24, 29], which are concerned with the stochastic heat equation driven
by the space-time white noise on an interval (0, L) in one spatial dimension. In the
Neumann case, they prove that full intermittency occurs for all levels λ > 0 of noise.
This suggests the formation of tall peaks for the solutions even when the noise level
is small. However, the precise intermittency behavior has not been well studied for
general domains under the Neumann boundary condition.
Another main contribution of the paper is about the weak conditions, namely, the
rough initial conditions, that we impose on the initial data ν. When U = Rd , i.e.,
the boundary is at |x| → ∞, and in case of L = − 21 , the rough initial condition

refers to locally finite (signed) measure on Rd that satisfies the following integrability
condition:

|ν|(dy) < ∞, for all t > 0 and x ∈ Rd .
(1.13)

Initial conditions of this type were studied in [8, 12, 13]; see also [15]. When the
domain U is bounded, we will show that the integrability condition (1.12) should be
replaced by
1 (y) |ν|(dy) < ∞,

(1.14)

U

where 1 (·) is the eigenfunction corresponding to the leading eigenvalue of the operator L. In particular, for the Neumann boundary condition case (see Theorems 1.4
and 1.5), since 1 (x) is a constant function that does not vanish at the boundary, condition (1.14) is equivalent to |μ|(U ) < ∞, i.e., |μ| is a finite measure on the domain
U . In case of the Dirichlet boundary condition (see Theorem 1.7 and Corollary 1.9),
condition (1.14) allows locally finite measure with certain growth rate near the boundary. For specific domains, condition (1.14) can be made more explicit; see examples
in Table 1.
In order to obtain precise moment results and allow rough initial conditions, we
start by considering in Lemmas 4.3 and 4.4 the following heat kernel integral:

U2

G(t, x, y)G t, x , y



f y−y



dy dy .

By using the heat kernel estimates in Proposition 3.6, we find that the sharp bound for
this integral is e−2μ1 t (1 ∧ t)−β/2 . In particular, the factor of (1 ∧ t)−β/2 improves the
estimates in [33]. Furthermore, we consider the convolution-type integral of the heat
kernel

U2

G(t − s, x, z)G(t − s, x , z ) f (z − z )G(s, z, y)G(s, z , y ) dz dz

−β/2
and obtain optimal bounds with a similar factor of 1∧ (t−s)s
. Also, based on these
t
optimal bounds and the convolution-type operator as considered in [4], we extend
the two-point correlation formula (1.11) and related bounds in Proposition 6.2, and
establish explicit upper and lower bounds for the kernel function in Propositions 6.5

and 6.7. In Theorem 1.5, we use these kernel bounds to obtain sharp bounds for the twopoint correlation function. In case of C 1,α -domains with Dirichlet boundary condition,
we improve the above bounds, in Lemma 7.1 and Proposition 7.2, by including a factor
which contains 1 (x) 1 (x ) 1 (y) 1 (y ).
As some applications of our moment bounds, in Theorems 2.5 and 2.8, we establish
the full intermittency property for sufficiently large λ under the Dirichlet boundary
condition, and for all λ > 0 under the Neumann boundary condition. This extends
significantly the results in [24]. We also apply our moment bounds to study the L 2 energy of the solution as a function of the parameter λ. This property has been studied
in [22] and [29] on (0, L) in the large λ regime, i.e., as λ → ∞, under the Neumann
boundary condition. In this paper, we study this property in both large and small λ
regimes and for a general bounded domain with Neumann boundary condition. We
find that, at a fixed time, when λ > 0 is small, the L 2 -energy of the solution on U has
the exponential rate exp(Cλ2 ), which is different from the rate exp(Cλ4/(2−β) ) when
λ is large (see Theorem 2.8 and Corollary 2.10).
Remark 1.3 Since the domain U is bounded, it is natural to study the SPDE in (1.3)
or (1.4) under the framework of infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equations
as in Da Prato and Zabczyk [17]; see also Cerrai [6] and Prévôt and Röckner [37].
However, in order to obtain sharper pointwise estimates of the probabilistic moments
with both t > 0 and x ∈ U fixed, and in order to demonstrate how the geometric
and analytic properties of the boundary ∂U affect the solution especially through the
initial conditions, we adopt the random field approach in this paper. The random field
approach was pioneered by Walsh [43] and extended by Dalang [18]; see [19] for a
comparison of the two approaches.
Before we state our main results, let us first introduce some notations. Throughout
the paper, G D and G N denote the Dirichlet and Neumann heat kernel, respectively.
We use G to denote either G D or G N when we do not need to distinguish the two
cases. We use · p to denote the L p ()-norm. Moreover, a ∧ b = min{a, b} for any
a, b ∈ R.
1.1 Main results
Our first theorem concerns the existence and uniqueness of random field solution (see
Definition 3.2 below) and the p-th moment bounds of the solution. For any c > 0, set
Jc (t, x) :=

(1.15)

It is clear that Jc (t, x) < ∞ for all t > 0 and x ∈ U if and only if |ν|(U ) < ∞, i.e.,
|ν| is a finite Borel measure on U . Let μ1 be the smallest positive eigenvalue of the
operator L with Dirichlet boundary condition on U , and 1 be the corresponding
eigenfunction such that

L 1 (x) = μ1 1 (x), x ∈ U ,
(1.16)
x ∈ ∂U ,
1 (x) = 0,

with 1 chosen to be positive and usually normalized
1 L 2 (U ) = 1; see Sect. 3.3.
We use the following convention for the constants μ, c, and c in Theorems 1.4, 1.5,
and 1.7. In case of Dirichlet (resp. Neumann) boundary condition, we set μ = μ1 ,
c = c1 , c = c2 (resp. μ = 0, c = c3 , c = c4 ) as the constants given by (3.6)
(resp. (3.7) and (3.8)) in Proposition 3.6 below.
Theorem 1.4 If U is a bounded Lipschitz domain, the noise Ẇ satisfies Assumption 1.1
and σ satisfies Assumption 1.2, then there exists a random field solution to (1.3) with
Dirichlet boundary condition (and (1.4) with Neumann boundary condition, respectively). Moreover:
(i) If ν has a bounded density, then for all T > 0 and all p ≥ 2,
sup sup u(t, x) p < ∞.

In both cases, the solution is unique among all random field solutions such that for
each T > 0, there exists C T < ∞ such that

(1.19)

Parts (i) and (ii) of Theorem 1.4 are proved in Sects. 4 and 5, respectively.
The next result is about the upper and lower bounds for the two-point correlation
of the solution. We need a few more notations: for x ∈ U , denote
dist(x, ∂U ) := inf {|x − y| : y ∈ ∂U } , Uε := {x ∈ U : dist(x, ∂U ) > ε} , (1.20)

Theorem 1.5 (Two-point correlation) Suppose that U is a bounded Lipschitz domain
and the initial data ν is a finite nonnegative measure on U . Assume that the noise Ẇ
satisfies Assumption 1.1 and σ satisfies Assumption 1.2. Let u be the solution to (1.3)
with Dirichlet boundary condition or (1.4) with Neumann boundary condition.
(i) Assume (1.10) or the nonnegativity of the solution, namely, u(t, x) ≥ 0 a.s. for all
(t, x) ∈ (0, ∞) × U . Then there exists a positive finite constant C such that for

In case of Neumann boundary condition, if the heat kernel lower bound (3.8) below
holds (which is the case, for example, when U is a smooth, convex domain and
L = − ; see Proposition 3.6 below), then there exists a constant C > 0 such
that (1.23) holds with ε = 0 for all t > 0 and x, x ∈ U .
Theorem 1.5 is proved at the end of Sect. 6.
Remark 1.6 (Nonnegativity and comparison principle) The condition u ≥ 0 a.s. in
Theorem 1.5 should be interpreted as u(t, x) ≥ 0 a.s. for all t > 0 and x ∈ U . It is
generally believed that under condition (1.8), if the initial condition is nonnegative,
then the solution to the stochastic heat equation (SHE) is nonnegative or even strictly
positive, which is indeed a consequence of the well-known sample-path comparison
principle for SHE. In particular, Mueller [31] established the sample-path comparison
principle for the case of SHE on [0, 1] with Neumann boundary conditions and spacetime white noise. Later, Shiga [41] proved the case of SHE on R with space-time white
noise. The case of SHE on [0, 1] with Dirichlet boundary conditions was proved by
Mueller and Nualart [32]. The case of SHE on R with a fractional Laplace, space-time
white noise, and rough initial conditions was established in [13] and the case of SHE
on Rd with rough initial data and with a noise that is white in time and homogeneously
colored in space was proved in [12]. The sample-path comparison principle under the
settings of the current paper is left as a future project.
The last set of results focus on the case of C 1,α -domains with the Dirichlet boundary
condition and some variations. Note that C 1,α -domains are a special case of Lipschitz
domains. We need to introduce some notations:
1 (x)
(t, x) := 1 ∧
1 ∧ t 1/2

|x−y|2

e−c t
and Jc∗ (t, x) :=
(t, y)
|ν|(dy),
1 ∧ t d/2
U

(1.24)

where 1 is the leading eigenfunction. In this case, we are able to improve the previous
results by giving a new condition (1.25) below, namely 1 ∈ L 1 (U , |ν|), which is
weaker than the above condition |ν|(U ) < ∞ in Theorem 1.4 for existence and all
moments of solutions with measure-valued initial data. This new integrability condition indicates the rate of blow-up for the initial data which is allowed near the boundary
∂U (see Examples 2.1–2.4 and Remark 1.8 below), and hence ν is not necessarily a
finite measure. Moreover, because



(t, x)
x∈∂U

123

1516

the bounds in (1.26), (1.28) and (1.29) below strengthen the previous bounds (1.18),
(1.22) and (1.23), respectively, especially near the boundary of the domain. Indeed,
(1) for any t > 0 fixed, when x is close to the boundary of U , the term (t, x) in (1.18)
and (1.22) plays the dominant role in pushing the moments to zero;
(2) for any x ∈ U fixed, since (·, ·) ≤ 1, when t → 0, the term Jc∗ (t, x)
( pt ∗ |ν|)(x) defines the behavior of the moments. Here, pt (x) is the heat kernel
on Rd and “∗” refers to the spatial convolution; see (1.13).
Theorem 1.7 Let U be a bounded C 1,α -domain for some α > 0 with the Dirichlet
boundary condition at ∂U . Assume that the noise Ẇ satisfies Assumption 1.1 and
σ satisfies Assumption 1.2. If the initial condition ν is any locally finite and signed
measure that satisfies the following integrability condition

1.2 Outline of the paper
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we first give some concrete
examples and apply our moment bounds to establish the full intermittency of the
solution and discuss its L 2 -energy. Then in Sect. 3, we give some preliminaries which
include the definition of the mild solution in Sect. 3.1, the cone condition for the domain
in Sect. 3.2, and the heat kernel estimates for the Eqs. (1.3) and (1.4) in Sect. 3.3. Then
in Sects. 4, resp. 5, we derive the moment bounds in case of bounded, resp. rough,
initial conditions, and prove the two cases in Theorem 1.4. The two-point correlation
function is studied in Sect. 6, where Theorem 1.5 is proved. The case of bounded
C 1,α -domains with Dirichlet condition is studied in Sect. 7, at the end of which we
prove Theorem 1.7 and Corollary 1.9.

2 Examples and applications
In this Section, we give some examples of our main results and apply our moment
bounds to study the intermittency property and the L 2 -energy of the solutions.
2.1 Rough initial conditions under Dirichlet boundary condition
In this part, we give a few examples to illustrate Theorem 1.7 and Corollary 1.9.
Example 2.1 (Interval for d = 1) Consider the stochastic heat Eq. (1.3) with L =
−∂ 2 /∂ x 2 on an interval U = (0, L) with Dirichlet boundary condition. This is a
smooth, and hence C 1,α domain. The first eigenvalue is μ1 = (π/L)2 and the corresponding eigenfunction is 1 (x) = (2/L)1/2 sin(π x/L). In this case, (t, x) defined
in (1.24) reduces to (see Fig. 2(2.1))
 (t, x) = 1 ∧

(2/L)1/2 sin (π x/L)
,
√
1∧ t

(2.1)

and condition (1.25) becomes
L

sin(π x/L) |ν|(dx) < ∞

L

⇐⇒

0

x(L − x) |ν|(dx) < ∞.

(2.2)

Due to the dissipative or cooling-down effect of the Dirichlet boundary condition,
one can inject, at time zero, more heat flow into the domain from the boundary. For
example, the following nonnegative measures with compact support satisfies (2.2) or
equivalently (1.25):
ν(dx) =

1(0,L) (x)
[sin(π x/L)]

Fig. 2 Some plots of the function (t, x) in case of d = 1 in Fig. 2.1 with L = 2, x ∈ [0, 2] and t ∈ [0, 3]
and (t, r ) in case of d ≥ 2 in Fig. 2.2 with d = 4, r ∈ [0, 1] and t ∈ [0, 3]. The normalization constant
Cd for the plot in Fig. 2.2 is chosen to be the one in (7.8) so that max(t,r )∈(0,∞)×(0,1) (t, r ) = 1

But since examples in (2.3) neither have bounded densities nor are finite measures on
the domain being considered, both parts of Theorem 1.4 fail to apply for such initial
conditions.

Example 2.2 (Unit ball in Rd ) Consider the stochastic heat Eq. (1.3) with L = −
on the unit disk U = B(0, 1) in Rd , d ≥ 2, with Dirichlet boundary condition. The first eigenvalue is μ1 = z 02 , where z 0 is the first positive zero of
the Bessel function J(d−2)/2 (·), and the corresponding eigenfunction is 1 (x) =
1
(2−d)/2 J
(d−2)/2 (z 0 |x|); see Remark 7.4 below for more details. In this case,
Cd |x|
(t, x) defined in (1.24) reduces to (see Fig. 2(2.2) with r = |x|)


U = x ∈ R2 : R1 < |x| < R2 , 0 < R1 < R2 < +∞.
Note that U is a nonconvex, but smooth, bounded domain. The leading eigenvalue is
μ1 = z 02 , where z 0 is the first positive zero of the cross-product Bessel functions
J0 (R1 z)Y0 (R2 z) − Y0 (R1 z)J0 (R2 z) = 0,

(2.7)

where J0 (·) and Y0 (·) are the Bessel functions of the first and second kind of order
zero, respectively. The corresponding eigenfunction is
1 (x) = C Z (|x|)

with Z (r ) := J0 (R1 z 0 )Y0 (r z 0 ) − Y0 (R1 z 0 )J0 (r z 0 );

Fig. 3 Some plots of the leading eigenfunction 1 (x) with x ∈ R2 both in case of the annular domain in
Fig. 3.1 where R1 = 1 and R2 = 3 and of the rectangular domain in Fig. 3.2 where L = 2

Note that the finiteness of the above constant C is due to the fact that R1 and R2 are
both simple zeros of Z (r ); see Lemma 7.5 below. By the same reason, in this case,
condition (1.25) can be equivalently written as

R1 <|x|<R2

(R2 − |x|) (|x| − R1 ) |ν|(dx) < ∞.

Eq. (1.3) with L = − on the rectangular domain U = (0, L)d ⊆ Rd , d ≥ 2
and L > 0, with Dirichlet boundary condition. Note that for d ≥ 2, U has corners
and hence, is not a C 1,α –domain, but only a Lipschitz domain. The first eigenvalue is

Other Lipschitz domains can be considered as an application of Corollary 1.9 as
well. For example, for the cylinder domain


U = (x1 , x2 , x3 ) ∈ R3 : x12 + x22 < 1 and 0 < x3 < 1 ,

(2.14)

The following two theorems extend the corresponding results in [24] and [33].
Recall that μ1 is the first eigenvalue of the operator L with Dirichlet boundary
condition. Also, recall the definitions of Jc (t, x) and Jc,ε (t, x) in (1.15) and (1.21),
respectively. The following theorem provides moment bounds for the solution and
shows that full intermittency occurs when λ is sufficiently large, but not when λ is
small.
Theorem 2.5 Let U ⊂ Rd be a bounded Lipschitz domain. Let u be the solution
to (1.3) with Dirichlet boundary condition. Suppose (1.8) holds. Suppose ν ≥ 0 and
ν(U ) < ∞. Then, there exist positive finite constants C, c and c such that for all
p ≥ 2, λ > 0, t > 0, x ∈ U ,

As in [24, 26, 33], it is not clear whether the solution is intermittent if λ ∈ [λ0 , λ1 ]
in Theorems 2.5 and 2.6 above. Instead, we propose the following conjecture for future
investigation.
Conjecture 2.7 Under the settings of either Theorem 2.5 or Theorem 2.6, there exists
λ∗ ∈ [λ0 , λ1 ] such that when λ > λ∗ , the solution u(t, x) to (1.3) is fully intermittent;
when λ < λ∗ , the solution has all p-th moments ( p ≥ 2) bounded in time and is not
fully intermittent.
Theorem 2.8 Let U ⊂ Rd be a convex bounded Lipschitz domain. Let u be the solution
to (1.4) with Neumann boundary condition. Suppose (1.8) holds. Suppose ν ≥ 0 and

2.3 L2 (U)-energy of solution

As a result of Theorems 2.5 and 2.8, we see that the solution is intermittent for λ
large under Dirichlet or Neumann boundary condition, and the energy of the solution
behaves like

2−β

for λ large.

Under Neumann boundary condition, the solution remains intermittent even when
λ > 0 is small. However, in this case, the energy of the solution has a different
exponential rate in λ than the one above, namely,
2

Et (λ) ∼ CeCtλ

for λ > 0 small.

In other words, the excitation index “at zero” is different. We obtain the following
corollaries:

3.2 Regularities and geometric properties of the domain
The definition of the Lipschitz domain is standard; see e.g. Section 1.2.1 of [25].
Definition 3.3 A bounded domain U ⊂ Rd is called a Lipschitz domain if there exist
positive constants K U and r0 such that for every q ∈ ∂U , there exist a Lipschitz
function Fq : Rd−1 → R satisfying |Fq (x) − Fq (x)| ≤ K U |x − x| for all x, x ∈
Rd−1 and an orthonormal coordinate system with origin q such that if z = (x, y),
x ∈ Rd−1 , y ∈ R, in this coordinate system, then


U ∩ B(q, r0 ) = B(q, r0 ) ∩ z = (x, y) : y > Fq (x)
and


∂U ∩ B(q, r0 ) = B(q, r0 ) ∩ z = (x, y) : y = Fq (x) ,
where B(q, r0 ) is the open ball centered at q of radius r0 . We call K U the Lipschitz
constant of U and r0 the localization radius of U .

Fig. 4 Illustration for the δ-cone property in Definition 3.4

Definition 3.4 (Definition 2.4.1 of [27]) For δ > 0, we say that U has the δ-cone
property if, for every x ∈ ∂U , there exists a unit vector ξx ∈ Rd such that for all
y ∈ U ∩ B(x, δ), we have C (y, ξx , δ) ⊂ U , where C (y, ξ, δ) is the δ-cone defined
by


C (y, ξ, δ) := z ∈ Rd : 0 < |z − y| < δ and (z − y) · ξ ≥ |z − y| cos(δ) . (3.4)
See Fig. 4 for an illustration.
It is clear that if U has the δ-cone property, then it also has the δ -cone property for
0 < δ ≤ δ. It is known that for a bounded domain U ⊂ Rd , it is a Lipschitz domain if
and only if it has the δ-cone property for some δ > 0; see, e.g., [27, Theorem 2.4.7] or
[25, Theorem 1.2.2.2]. In particular, according to the above definitions, one can easily
see that if U is a Lipschitz domain, then it satisfies the δ-cone condition with
δ = arctan(1/K U ) ∧ r0 .

(3.5)

The δ-cone property gives us a convenient way to handle the Lipschitz domain.
Example 3.5 Any C 1,α -domain with α > 0 is a Lipschitz domain; see, e.g., [35].
The unit ball in Rd is a smooth domain and also a C 1,α -domain. U = (−1, 1)d is a
Lipschitz domain but not a C 1,α -domain for any α > 0. Domains with cusps are not
Lipschitz domain; see Fig. 1(1.5).
3.3 Heat kernel estimates
Recall that L is the operator defined in divergence form (1.1) satisfying the uniformly
elliptic condition (1.2). It is known that the operator L with Dirichlet boundary
condition on U has a discrete spectrum with a sequence of positive eigenvalues 0 <
μ1 ≤ μ2 ≤ . . . such that the first eigenvalue μ1 is simple and its eigenfunction 1 can
be chosen to be positive and
1 L 2 (U ) = 1; see, e.g., [20]. Moreover, we have the
following heat kernel estimates under Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.
Proposition 3.6 Let U ⊂ Rd be a bounded Lipschitz domain. Then the following
estimates hold.

Proof The Dirichlet case is proved in [38] (see Theorem 2.1 and Remark 1 on p.123).
For the Neumann case, the upper bound in (3.7) can be found in Theorem 3.2.9 of [20],
where we note that the extension property referred in that theorem (ibid.) is satisfied
by the Lipschitz domain (see either Proposition 1.7.9 of [20] or Theorem 1.4.3.1 of
[25]). The lower bound in (3.8) follows from [40, Theorem 3.1 and Examples 3.3];
see also [39].


Remark 3.7 In the Dirichlet boundary condition case, by [38, (1.2)], there exists a
finite constant c0 > 1 such that for all z ∈ U ,

1 (z) ≤ c0 [dist(z, ∂U )] ,

where a1 and a2 are constants from part (i) of Proposition 3.6.
Remark 3.8 In general, Theorem 3.1 of [40] states that the following conditions are
equivalent:

is, for all t > 0 and x, y ∈ U ,

• The domain U has the volume doubling property and the Poincaré inequality holds.
The results of the present paper under the Neumann boundary condition, especially
the lower bound results, remain valid for U satisfying any one of the above equivalent
conditions.
In the rest of the paper, the lower case constants c1 , c2 , c3 , c4 are reserved for the
constants given by Proposition 3.6 above.
Before the end of this subsection, we prove that the Lipschitz domain U satisfies the
lower bound in (3.11) below. The following lemma may well be buried in the literature.
Since its proof is short, it will be given below. Let Vol(A) denote the volume (or ddimensional Lebesgue measure) of any measurable set A in Rd .
Lemma 3.9 Suppose that U is a bounded Lipschitz domain in Rd . Then, there exists
positive finite constants C and C such that for all y ∈ U and r > 0,
C(1 ∧ r )d ≤ Vol(U ∩ B(y, r )) ≤ C (1 ∧ r )d .

(3.11)

Proof The upper bound is trivial since Vol(U ∩ B(y, r )) ≤ Vol(U )∧Vol(B(y, r )). We
only need to prove the lower bound. It is known that the Lipschitz domain U satisfies
the δ-cone property with δ given in (3.5).
We first consider the case of 0 < r < δ. If dist(y, ∂U ) > r , then B(y, r ) ⊂ U and
Vol(U ∩ B(y, r )) = Vol(B(y, r )) = Vd r d ≥ Vd (1 ∧ r )d ,
where Vd = π d/2 / (d/2 + 1). If dist(y, ∂U ) ≤ r , then y ∈ B(x, δ) for some
x ∈ ∂U , and by the δ-cone property, we can find a unit vector ξ = ξx ∈ Rd such that
C (y, ξ, δ) ⊂ U . It follows that
Vol(U ∩ B(y, r )) ≥ Vol(C (y, ξ, δ) ∩ B(y, r ))
= Vol{z ∈ Rd : 0 < |z − y| < r and (z − y) · ξ ≥ |z − y| cos δ}
= Cd,δ Vd r d ,
where Cδ,d ∈ (0, 1]. Therefore, when r ∈ (0, δ), Vol(U ∩ B(y, r )) ≥ Cd,δ Vd (1 ∧ r )d .
Finally, the case of r ≥ δ follows from the previous case because
Vol(U ∩ B(y, r )) ≥ Vol(U ∩ B(y, δ)) ≥ Cd,δ Vd δ d ≥ Cd,δ Vd δ d (1 ∧ r )d .
This implies the desired lower bound with C = Cd,δ Vd (1 ∧ δ)d .




Next, we need to replace U in (3.11) above by a subset of U with some specific
properties. Take 0 < ε1 < 1 such that Uε1 = ∅ (see (1.20)) and let
ε0 = ε1 ∧ (δ/2).

m
(2) If x ∈

B(yi , ε0 ), then dist(x, ∂U ) > ε0 /2 and thus B(x, ε0 /2) ⊂ U .


V (x) =

C (x, ξ yi , ε0 /2) in case (1),
B(x, ε0 /2)
in case (2).

(3.13)

The next lemma will be used later together with the heat kernel estimates to derive
the lower bounds in Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2 below.
Lemma 3.10 Let U ⊂ Rd be a bounded Lipschitz domain with the δ-cone property.
Let ε0 ∈ (0, 1) and V (x) ⊂ U , for x ∈ U , be defined by (3.12) and (3.13) above.
Then, for each ε ∈ (0, ε0 ] there exists cε > 0 with limε→0 cε = 0 such that for all
x ∈ Uε , we have
d(z) := dist(z, ∂U ) ≥ cε for all z ∈ V (x)

(3.14)

Vol(V (x) ∩ B(x, r )) ≥ C(1 ∧ r )d for all r > 0,

(3.15)

and

where C > 0 is a constant depending on d and ε0 .
Proof Let ε ∈ (0, ε0 ]. We first prove (3.14). On the one hand, for each i and x ∈
Uε ∩ B(yi , ε0 /2), by the δ-cone property of U , we have C (x, ξ yi , ε0 /2) ⊂ U , which
implies that

dist C (x, ξ yi , ε0 /2), ∂U := inf |z − y| : z ∈ C (x, ξ yi , ε0 /2), y ∈ ∂U > 0.

123

Stochastics and Partial Differential Equations: Analysis and Computations (2024) 12:1507–1573

1533

Since the function x → dist(C (x, ξ yi , ε0 /2), ∂U ) is continuous on the compact set
Uε ∩ B(yi , ε0 /2), we can find cε,i > 0 such that dist(C (x, ξ yi , ε0 /2), ∂U ) ≥ cε,i for
all x ∈ Uε ∩ B(yi , ε0 /2).
m
On the other hand, for x ∈ Uε \ i=1
B(yi , ε0 /2), we have B(x, ε0 /2) ⊂ U , and
hence
dist(B(x, ε0 /2), ∂U ) > 0.
Then,
mby the continuity of x → dist(B(x, ε0 /2), ∂U ) and the compactness of
Uε \ i=1
B(yi ,
ε0 /2), we can find cε,0 > 0 such that dist(B(x, ε0 /2), ∂U ) ≥ cε,0
m
for all x ∈ Uε \ i=1
B(yi , ε0 /2).
Therefore, by taking cε = min{cε,i : 0 ≤ i ≤ m}, we get that dist(V (x), ∂U ) ≥ cε .
Also, note that for 1 ≤ i ≤ m, we have 0 < cε,i ≤ ε, so cε → 0 as ε → 0. This
proves (3.14).
As for (3.15), if V (x) = C (x, ξ yi , ε0 /2) in case (1) of (3.13), then
Vol(V (x) ∩ B(x, r )) = Vol(C (x, ξ yi , ε0 /2) ∩ B(x, r ))
= Vol{z ∈ Rd : 0 ≤ |z − x| < (ε0 /2) ∧ r and (z − x)
· ξ yi ≥ |z − x| cos(ε0 /2)}
= Cd,ε0 ((ε0 /2) ∧ r )d ≥ Cd,ε0 (ε0 /2)d (1 ∧ r )d .
If V (x) = B(x, ε0 /2) in case (2) of (3.13), then
Vol(V (x) ∩ B(x, r )) = Vol(B(x, (ε0 /2) ∧ r )) = Cd ((ε0 /2) ∧ r )d
≥ Cd (ε0 /2)d (1 ∧ r )d .
This shows (3.15) and completes the proof of Lemma 3.10.

4 Bounded initial condition case
In this section, we give some computations to show how the noise interacts with the
differential operator. Let us first give a general definition, which is not only restricted
to the heat equation.
Definition 4.1 Let U be a general domain in Rd and let G(t, x, y) be the fundamental
solution to the corresponding partial differential equation. Let f be a nonnegative,
nonnegative definite function. Let h U

The following two lemmas provide estimates for k U (t) in the case of the Dirichlet
and Neumann heat kernel, respectively. In particular, for the case of L = − , our
lower and upper bounds generalize (3.3) and (3.5) of [33] from U being an open ball
to more general domains.

As for part (iii), using (4.12), interchanging the order of summation and applying (4.11) yield (4.13). Finally, for part (iv), after an application of the sub-additivity

of the function x → x 1/ p to the far right-hand side of (4.12), one can carry out the
same arguments as the proof of the upper bound of (4.13) to show that the series in
question converges. This completes the proof of Lemma 4.6.


The above lemma plays the same role as, e.g., Lemma A.2 of [11] where the kernel
function k(t) takes the form of (t − s)−ρ . In that case, the computations can be made
explicit by using the Mittag-Leffler function. Indeed, Lemma 4.6 can be rephrased as
the Gronwall-type lemma below.
Lemma 4.7 (Gronwall-type Lemma) Let λ ∈ R+ , ρ ∈ (0, 1), 
k(t) = (1 ∧ t)−ρ and
b : R+ → R+ be a nonnegative function. Suppose that H : R+ → R+ is a locally
integrable nonnegative function such that for all t ≥ 0,

the conclusion (4.19) with “≤” replaced by “≥” (resp. “=”). This can be shown by
the same proof below.

4.1 Proof of part (i) of Theorem 1.4
Now we are ready to prove Theorem 1.4 for the case where the initial data is bounded.
Proof of Theorem 1.4 (the bounded initial data case) Here we assume that the initial
condition ν is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure with a
bounded density g, namely, ν(dx) = g(x)dx and g ∈ L ∞ (U ). The proof follows a
standard Picard iteration scheme. Let u 0 (t, x) = J (t, x) (see (3.3)) and for n ≥ 1,
t

u n (t, x) = J (t, x) + λ

G(t − s, x, y)σ (s, y, u n−1 (s, y))W (ds, dy).

where C p is a constant depending only on p. By Lemma 4.3 (for the Dirichlet case)
or Lemma 4.4 (for the Neumann case),

||u n (s, x) − u n−1 (s, x)||2p .

For any t ∈ [0, T ] with T fixed, using the notation in Definition 4.5 with ρ = β/2,

the above bound can be written as H1 (t) ≤ C T a(



p = 2 to see that ∞
n=1 Hn (t) < ∞. This implies that u n (t, x) converges to some
p
u(t, x) in L () which satisfies (3.2) and (1.17).
For the uniqueness, suppose that u and 
u are two mild solutions satisfying (1.17)
with p = 2. By Burkholder’s inequality with p = 2 and similar calculations to those
above, we get that
H (t) ≤ Cλ2 L 2σ

t

H (s)(1 ∧ (t − s))−β/2 ds, for all t > 0,

0

where H (t) := sup(s,x)∈(0,t]×U ||u(s, x) − ũ(s, x)||22 . The condition (1.17) implies
that H is locally bounded. Then we can apply the Gronwall-type Lemma 4.7 with
b(t) ≡ 0 to see that H (t) ≡ 0, i.e., u(t, x) = 
u (t, x) a.s. This completes the proof of
Theorem 1.4 in the case where the initial measure has a bounded density.

5 The p-th moment bounds and rough initial data

kernels. Specifically, we seek optimal upper and lower bounds for the integral:

G(t − s, x, z)G(t − s, x , z ) f (z − z )G(s, z, y)G(s, z , y ) dz dz .

we provide a direct proof. We prove (5.9) by induction. Clearly, it holds for n = 0.
Suppose it holds for some n ≥ 0. Since (t − s)s/t ≥ s/2 for s ∈ [0, t/2] and

6 The two-point correlation function
6.1 A general formula for the two-point correlation function
The authors in [14] have defined and studied the space-time convolution-type operator
“ ” for the heat kernel in the whole space Rd , where the heat kernel G(t, x, y) can
be written as G(t, x − y). However, when the domain is not the whole space Rd , for
example when it is a bounded domain, this translation invariant property is no longer
true and one has to keep the fundamental solution in the form of three parameters. This
natural generalization of the operator “ ” for fundamental solutions from those with
two parameters to those with three has been carried out by the first author’s thesis; see
[4, Chapter 5]. Here, let us first briefly recall this generalization.
For two measurable functions k1 , k2 : R+ × U 4 → R, we define
(k1

k2 )(t, x, x , y, y )
t

=

ds
U2

0

dz dz k1 (t − s, x, x , z, z )k2 (s, z, z , y, y ) f (z − z )

(6.1)

whenever the multiple integral is well-defined. For h : R+ × U 2 → R, we define
k1 h = k1 h, where h(t, x, x , y, y ) := h(t, x, x ).
Remark 6.1 In [14], where U = Rd , the operator “ ” is defined by
(k1

k2 )(t, x, x ; y) =



for measurable functions ki : R+ × R3 → R, i = 1, 2. The prototype of the function
k is k(t, x, x ; y) = G(t, x − y)G(t, x − y), which corresponds to (and actually
equals to) J (t, x)J (t, x ) when the initial condition is ν = δ y . But when there is
a lack of space invariance, one has to write this function k as k(t, x, x , y, y ) =
G(t, x, y)G(t, x , y ). Indeed, introducing one more parameter in the definition of the
convolution operator “ " makes the associative property much more straightforward:
Provided that one can apply Fubini’s theorem to interchange of the order of integration,
one gets that for any measurable functions k1 , k2 , k3 : R+ × U 4 → R,
(k1

(k2

k3 ))(t, x, x , y, y ) = ((k1

k2 ) k3 )(t, x, x , y, y ).

(6.2)

Therefore, it makes sense to write k1 k2 k3 without parentheses to specify the order.
Moreover, for any n ≥ 1, we define k n by k n := k · ·!· k".

bounds for KλD and KλN will be proved later in Propositions 6.5 and 6.7. In particular,
the upper bounds there imply the convergence of the series in (6.3).
The connection between the two-point correlation function and the function Kλ is
given by the next proposition.
Proposition 6.2 Let U be a bounded Lipschitz domain and u(t, x) be the solution
of (1.3) or (1.4). Recall that J (t, x) is the solution to the homogeneous equation;
see (3.3). Let J(t, x, x ) = J (t, x)J (t, x ).

Remark 6.3 Note that case (i) in the above proposition covers the important special
case—the Anderson model. In this case, the two-point correlation function enjoys an
explicit formula, having an equality in (6.4). For the nonlinear case, one needs to either
introduce a cone condition, σ (t, x, u) ≥ lσ |u|, for the lower bounds as in case (ii) or
assume the nonnegativity of solution for the upper bounds as in case (iii).

function once we have some useful bounds for Kλ . Therefore, our goal is to establish
explicit upper and lower bounds for Kλ . To this end, we first prove a lemma which
strengthens Lemma 3.10.
Lemma 6.4 Let U ⊂ Rd be a bounded Lipschitz domain with the δ-cone property.
Let 0 < ε0 < 1 be defined by (3.12), and recall that, for each x ∈ U , V (x) is
the subset of U defined in (3.13). Then, there is a positive constant C such that the
following property holds: For any ε ∈ (0, ε0 ], for any x ∈ Uε , for any r , s such that
0 < r ≤ s ≤ ε0 /2, for any z ∈ V (x) ∩ B(x, s), we have
Vol(V (x) ∩ B(x, s) ∩ B(z, r )) ≥ C(1 ∧ r )d .

Proof First, suppose that case (2) in (3.13) holds. Then for all z ∈ B(x, s) and 0 <
r ≤ s ≤ ε0 /2, we have
V (x) ∩ B(x, s) ∩ B(z, r ) = B(x, s) ∩ B(z, r ).
This intersection clearly contains a ball of radius r /3, and hence has volume which is
bounded from below by C(r /3)d .
Suppose that case (1) in (3.13) holds. Let
C1 = {y ∈ Rd : 0 < |y| < 1 and y · ξ > |y| cos(ε0 /2)}.
Note that C1 is a bounded convex domain, so it satisfies the δ̄-cone property for some
δ̄ > 0 by Proposition 2.4.4 of [27]. By scaling and translation, we see that


Vol(V (x) ∩ B(x, s) ∩ B(z, r )) = s d Vol C1 ∩ B((z − x)/s, r /s)
with (z − x)/s ∈ C1 and 0 < r /s ≤ 1. So, it suffices to prove the existence of a
constant C > 0 such that
Vol(C1 ∩ B(w, r )) ≥ Cr d , for all w ∈ C1 and r ∈ (0, 1].

(6.9)

To prove (6.9), we first consider the case that 0 < r ≤ δ̄. If dist(w, ∂C1 ) ≥ δ̄, then
B(w, r ) ⊂ C1 and hence
Vol(C1 ∩ B(w, r )) = C1r d .
If dist(w, ∂C1 ) < δ̄, then w ∈ C1 ∩ B(v, δ̄) for some v ∈ ∂C1 . By the δ̄-cone property
of C1 , we can find a unit vector η = ηv ∈ Rd such that C (w, η, δ̄) ⊂ C1 . Then,
Vol(C1 ∩ B(w, r ))
≥ Vol(C (w, η, δ̄) ∩ B(w, r ))
= Vol{y ∈ Rd : 0 < |y − w| < r and (y − w) · η ≥ |y − w| cos(ε0 /2)}
≥ C2r d .
Finally, consider the case that δ̄ < r ≤ 1. We have C1 ∩ B(w, r ) ⊃ C1 ∩ B(w, δ̄).
Then, by the first case that we just proved,
Vol(C1 ∩ B(w, r )) ≥ (C1 ∧ C2 )δ̄ d ≥ (C1 ∧ C2 )δ̄ d r d .

This completes the proof of Lemma 6.4.
Now, we are ready to establish upper and lower bounds for KλD and KλN .
Proposition 6.5 Let U be a bounded Lipschitz domain. Then:

and C → 0, c̄ → 0 and 
We first make a few remarks:
Remark 6.6
(1) Under the conditions of Proposition 6.2, for the delta initial condition ν = δ y , we
have
(λlσ )−2 KλD (t, x, x , y, y) ≤ E(u(t, x)u(t, x )) ≤ (λL σ )−2 KλD (t, x, x , y, y).
(2) Proposition 6.5 applies to all bounded Lipschitz domains. But in case of C 1,α domains, we will improve the bounds (6.10) and (6.11) in Proposition 7.2 so that
the moment estimates will be consistent with Dirichlet condition at the boundary,
namely,
lim

x or x →∂U

E(u(t, x)u(t, x )) = 0.

(3) In case of U = Rd , the factor exp(−c|x − x |2 /t) in (6.11) also appears in the
lower bound in Lemma 2.7 of [14]. We think that a sharp upper bound for KλD
would have this extra exponential factor as well.
Proof of Proposition 6.5

6.3 Proof of Theorem 1.5
Proof of Theorem 1.5 The correlation bounds (1.22) and (1.23) under Dirichlet condition (or Neumann condition, respectively) follows immediately from Propositions 6.2
and 6.5 (or 6.2 and 6.7, respectively).

7 The case of bounded C 1,˛ -domains with Dirichlet condition and
some variations
In the case of C 1,α -domains, one can expect better moment estimates under Dirichlet
boundary condition because the heat kernel estimates in (3.6) hold with a1 = a2 =
1. This implies that the Dirichlet heat kernel estimates in (3.6) are
 sharp, yielding

1 (x)
matching upper and lower bounds with the same factor 1 ∧ 1∧t 1/2 1 ∧ 1∧t1 (y)
1/2 .
7.1 Better estimates for the resolvent kernel K
In this part, we study the case of bounded C 1,α -domains with Dirichlet boundary
condition. For the points x, x , y, y that are close to ∂U , the lemma below provides
more precise estimate than what one gets from the upper bound in Lemma 5.1.
Lemma 7.1 If U is a bounded C 1,α -domain for some α > 0, then there exists a positive
finite constant C such that for all t > 0, for all x, x , y, y ∈ U ,

where C0 is a finite constant depending on c0 , c1 and the diameter of U . This

In order to prove the lemma, we split the integral over [0, t] into the sum of the
integral over [t/2, t] and the integral over [0, t/2]. Denote these two integrals by I1

We can now strengthen the bounds (6.10) and (6.11) for KλD (t, x, x , y, y ) in the
case of bounded C 1,α -domains. Note that (t, x) = 0 for all x ∈ ∂U , hence (7.3)

Remark 7.4 In the setting of Example 2.2, the leading eigenfunction is given by
1 (x) =

1
|x|(2−d)/2 J(d−2)/2 (z 0 |x|) ,
Cd

where z 0 is the first positive zero of the Bessel function J(d−2)/2 (x), and Cd is some
normalization constant. One may refer to §34.2 in Chapter III of [42] for the case
d = 2 and Section H in Chapter 2 of [21] for the general case d ≥ 3. In particular,
the leading eigenfunction 1 (x) corresponds to Fklm (x) in Theorem 2.66 (ibid.) with
k = 0, l = 1 and m = 1. Here are a few comments:
(1) The multiplicity for the leading eigenvalue z 0 is one since dk = 1; see Corollary
2.55 (ibid.).
(2) Y01 (x) in Theorem 2.66 (ibid.) is a constant function.
(3) In Fig. 2(2.2), we have chosen the following normalization constant:

Cd = lim r (2−d)/2 J(n−2)/2 (z 0 r ) = 2−d/2 d  (1 + d/2)−1 z 0

where the limit is due to [34, Eq. 10.7.3 on p. 223], so that max|x|≤1 (1, x) = 1.
The following Lemma is used in Example 2.3.
Lemma 7.5 R1 and R2 are two simple zeros for Z (r ) defined in Example 2.3.
Proof It is straightforward to check that R1 and R2 are two zeros of Z (r ). To show that
they are simple, one needs to prove that Z (r ) = 0 for r = R1 and R2 . By Eq. 10.6.3
of [34], we see that
z 0−1 Z (r ) = J0 (R1 z 0 )Y0 (r z 0 ) − J0 (r z 0 )Y0 (R1 z 0 )
= −J0 (R1 z 0 )Y1 (r z 0 ) + J1 (r z 0 )Y0 (R1 z 0 ).

By setting r = R1 and applying Eq. 10.5.2 (ibid.), we have that

2
= 0,
π R1 z 0

which proves that R1 is a simple zero of Z (r ).
Let F(z) denote the function in (2.7). By setting r = R2 , we have
z 0−1 Z (R2 ) = −J0 (R1 z 0 )Y1 (R2 z 0 ) + J1 (R2 z 0 )Y0 (R1 z 0 ).

(7.9)

Because J02 (z) + Y02 (z) > 0 for all z > 0 (see, e.g., Eq. 10.9.30 ibid), we see that if
Y0 (R1 z 0 ) = 0, then J0 (R1 z 0 ) = 0. Because all zeros of Yν (·) are simple, we see that
Y1 (R1 z 0 ) = −Y0 (R1 z 0 ) = 0. But since z 0 is a zero of F(z), i.e.,
0 = J0 (R1 z 0 )Y0 (R2 z 0 ) − J0 (R2 z 0 )Y0 (R1 z 0 ) = J0 (R1 z 0 )Y0 (R2 z 0 ).
Hence Y0 (R2 z 0 ) = 0, which further implies that both J0 (R2 z 0 ) = 0 and Y1 (R2 z 0 ) =
−Y0 (R2 z 0 ) = 0. This proves Case 1 in Table 3a. Applying the same arguments with
Y0 (R1 z 0 ) = 0 replaced by Y0 (R2 z 0 ) = 0, J0 (R1 z 0 ) = 0, and J0 (R2 z 0 ) = 0, we see
that only three cases can happen, which are listed in the following Table 3:
Cases 1 and 2: From the expression of Z (R2 ) in (7.9), we see that in these two cases,
Z (R2 ) = 0.
Case 3: Since both Y0 (R1 z 0 ) and Y0 (R2 z 0 ) are nonzero, and since F(z 0 ) = 0, we see
that
J0 (R1 z 0 ) =

Y0 (R1 z 0 )J0 (R2 z 0 )
.
Y0 (R2 z 0 )

This and Eq. 10.5.2 (ibid.) imply that
Y0 (R1 z 0 )
(−J0 (R2 z 0 )Y1 (R2 z 0 ) + J1 (R2 z 0 )Y0 (R2 z 0 ))
Y0 (R2 z 0 )
Y0 (R1 z 0 ) 2
= 0.
=
Y0 (R2 z 0 ) π R2 z 0

z 0−1 Z (R2 ) =

Therefore, combining the above three cases, we have proved that R2 is a simple zero
of Z (r ).
