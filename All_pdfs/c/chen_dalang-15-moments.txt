MOMENTS AND GROWTH INDICES FOR THE NONLINEAR
STOCHASTIC HEAT EQUATION WITH ROUGH
INITIAL CONDITIONS1
B Y L E C HEN AND ROBERT C. DALANG
École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne
We study the nonlinear stochastic heat equation in the spatial domain R,
driven by space–time white noise. A central special case is the parabolic Anderson model. The initial condition is taken to be a measure on R, such as the
Dirac delta function, but this measure may also have noncompact support and
even be nontempered (e.g., with exponentially growing tails). Existence and
uniqueness of a random field solution is proved without appealing to Gronwall’s lemma, by keeping tight control over moments in the Picard iteration
scheme. Upper bounds on all pth moments (p ≥ 2) are obtained as well as
a lower bound on second moments. These bounds become equalities for the
parabolic Anderson model when p = 2. We determine the growth indices introduced by Conus and Khoshnevisan [Probab. Theory Related Fields 152
(2012) 681–701].

by many authors: See [2–5, 8–10, 16, 19] for the intermittency problem, [14, 15]
for probabilistic potential theory, [26, 27] for regularity of the solution and [12, 22,
23, 25, 28] for several other properties. The important special case ρ(u) = λu is
called the parabolic Anderson model [5]. Our work focuses on (1.1) with general
deterministic initial data μ, and we study how the initial data affects the moments
and asymptotic properties of the solution.
For the existence of random field solutions (see Definition 2.1 below) to (1.1),
the case where the initial data μ is a bounded and measurable function is covered
by the classical theory of Walsh [29]. Initial data that is more irregular than this

Bertini and Cancrini [3] gave an ad-hoc definition of solution for the parabolic
Anderson model via a smoothing of the space–time white noise and a Feynman–
Kac type formula. Their analysis depended heavily on properties of the local times
of Brownian bridges. Recently, Conus and Khoshnevisan [9] have constructed a
weak solution defined through certain norms on random fields. In particular, their
solution is defined for almost all (t, x), but not at specific (t, x). Their initial data
has to verify certain technical conditions, which are satisfied by the Dirac delta
function in some of their cases. More recently, Conus, Joseph, Khoshnevisan and
Shiu [8] also studied random field solutions. In particular, they require the initial
data to be a finite measure of compact support.
After the basic questions of existence, the asymptotic properties of the solution
are of particular interest, in part because the solution exhibits intermittency properties. More precisely, define the upper and lower Lyapunov exponents as follows:
(1.3)

log E[|u(t, x)|p ]
,
t
t→+∞

mp (x) := lim sup
(1.4)

log E[|u(t, x)|p ]
.
t→+∞
t
When the initial data is constant, these two exponents do not depend on x. In this
case, following Bertini and Cancrini [3], we say that the solution is intermittent if
mn := mn = mn for all n ∈ N and the following strict inequalities are satisfied:
mn

Carmona and Molchanov gave the following definition [5], Definition III.1.1, on
page 55.
mp (x) := lim inf

D EFINITION 1.1. Let p be the smallest integer for which mp > 0. If p < ∞,
then we say that the solution u(t, x) exhibits (asymptotic) intermittency of order p,
and if p = 2, then it exhibits full intermittency.
Carmona and Molchanov [5] showed that full intermittency implies the intermittency defined by (1.5) (see [5], Theroem III.1.2, on page 55). This mathematical
definition of intermittency is related to the property that the solutions are close to

zero in vast regions of space–time but develop high peaks on some small “islands.”
For the parabolic Anderson model, this property has been well studied; see [5, 11]
for a discrete formulation and [3, 16, 19] for the continuous formulation. Further
general discussion of the intermittency property can be found in [30].
When the initial data are not homogeneous, in particular, when they have certain
decrease at infinity, Conus and Khoshnevisan [10] defined the following lower and
upper exponential growth indices:
(1.6)

λ(p) := sup α > 0 : lim sup
t→∞

(1.7)

λ(p) := inf α > 0 : lim sup
t→∞

p
sup log E u(t, x) > 0 ,
t |x|≥αt


1
p
sup log E u(t, x) < 0 .
t |x|≥αt

These quantities are of interest because they give information about the possible locations of high peaks, and how they propagate away from the origin.
Indeed, if λ(p) = λ(p) =: λ(p), then there will be high peaks at time t inside [−λ(p)t, λ(p)t], but no peaks outside of this interval. Conus and Khoshnevisan [10] proved in particular that if the initial data μ is a nonnegative, lower
semicontinuous function with compact support of positive Lebesgue measure, then
for the Anderson model,
λ2

≤ λ(2) ≤ λ(2) ≤ .

In this paper, we improve the existence result by working under a much weaker
condition on the initial data, namely, μ can be any signed Borel measure over R
such that
(1.8)

e−ax |μ|(dx) < +∞
2

(1.9)

R

for all a > 0,

where, from the Jordan decomposition, μ = μ+ − μ− where μ± are two nonnegative Borel measures with disjoint support and |μ| := μ+ + μ− . Note that the
condition (1.9) is equivalent to




|μ| ∗ Gν (t, ·) (x) < +∞

for all t > 0 and x ∈ R,

which means that under condition (1.9), the solution to the homogeneous heat
equation with initial data μ is well defined for all time.
On the one hand, condition (1.9) allows for measure-valued initial data, such
as the Dirac delta function, and Proposition 2.11 below shows that initial data
cannot be extended beyond measures to other Schwartz distributions, even with
compact support. On the other hand, the condition (1.9) permits certain exponential
growth at infinity. For instance, if μ(dx) = f (x) dx, then f (x) = exp(a|x|p ), a >
0, p ∈ ]0, 2[ (i.e., exponential growth at ±∞), will satisfy this condition. Note
that the case where the initial data is a continuous function with linear exponential

growth (i.e., p = 1) has been considered by many authors; see [23, 25, 28] and the
references therein.
Next, we obtain estimates for the moments E(|u(t, x)|p ) with both t and x fixed
for all even integers p ≥ 2 (see Theorem 2.4). In particular, for the parabolic Anderson model, we give an explicit formula for the second moment of the solution.
When the initial data is either Lebesgue measure or the Dirac delta function, we
give explicit formulas for the two-point correlation functions [see (2.27) and (2.30)
below], which can be compared to the integral form given by Bertini and Cancrini [3], Corollaries 2.4 and 2.5 (see also Remark 2.6 below).
Recently, Borodin and Corwin [4] also obtained the moment formulas for the
parabolic Anderson model in the case where the initial data is the Dirac delta
function. When p = 2, we obtain the same explicit formula. For p > 2, their pth
moments are represented by multiple contour integrals. Our methods are very different from theirs: They approximate the continuous system by a discrete one. Our
formulas allow more general initial data than the Dirac delta function, and are useful for establishing other properties, concerning for instance growth indices and
sample path regularity.
Our proof of existence is based on the standard Picard iteration scheme. The
main difference from the conventional situation is that instead of applying Gronwall’s lemma to bound the second moment from above, we keep tight control over
the sequence of second moments in the Picard iteration scheme. In the case of the
parabolic Anderson model, this directly gives an explicit formula, and for more
general functions ρ it gives good bounds. Note that series representations of the
moments are obtained in [17], yielding a Feynman–Kac-type formula.
Concerning growth indices, we improve (1.8) by giving upper bounds on λ(p)
for general functions ρ, and, in the parabolic Anderson model, by showing that
λ(2) = λ(2) = λ2 /2 when μ is a nonnegative measure with compact support (see
Theorem 2.12), and we extend this result to a more general class of measure-valued
initial data (not necessarily with compact support). This is possible mainly thanks
to our explicit formula for the second moment. Our result implies in particular
that with regard to the propagation of high peaks, an initial condition with tails
that decrease at a sufficiently high exponential rate [as least as fast as e−β|x| with
β ≥ λ2 /(2ν)] produces the same behavior as a compactly supported one.
This paper is organized as follows: All the main results of this paper are stated
in Section 2. In particular, in Section 2.1, we define the notion of random field solution of (1.1), and then show, assuming existence of the solution, that one obtains
readily formulas for the second moments in the case of the Anderson model. Then
we state and prove our theorem on existence, uniqueness and moment estimates,
discuss various particular initial conditions, including Lebesgue measure and the
Dirac delta function, and we show that existence is not possible if the initial condition is rougher than a measure. In Section 2.2, we state the results about the growth
indices. Proofs of the results in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 are given in Sections 3 and 4,
respectively. Finally, in Section 4.3, we gather various calculations that are used
throughout the paper.

be the natural filtration of W augmented by the σ -field N generated by all P -null
sets in F . In the following, we fix the filtered probability space { , F , {Ft , t ≥
0}, P }. We use · p to denote the Lp ( )-norm (p ≥ 1). With this setup,
W becomes a worthy martingale measure in the sense of Walsh [29], and
[0,t]×R X(s, y)W (ds, dy) is well defined in this reference for a suitable class of
random fields {X(s, y), (s, y) ∈ R+ × R}.
We can formally rewrite the spde (1.1) in the integral form:
u(t, x) = J0 (t, x) + I (t, x),

We use the convention that Gν (t, ·) ≡ 0 if t ≤ 0. Hence, [0, t] × R in the stochastic
integral above can be replaced by R+ × R. In the following, we will use to denote
the simultaneous convolution in both space and time variables,
D EFINITION 2.1. A process u = (u(t, x), (t, x) ∈ R∗+ × R) is called a random
field solution to (2.2) if:
(1) u is adapted, that is, for all (t, x) ∈ R∗+ × R, u(t, x) is Ft -measurable;
(2) u is jointly measurable with respect to B (R∗+ × R) × F ;
ρ(u) 22 )(t, x) < +∞ for all (t, x) ∈ R∗+ × R, and the function
(3) (G2ν
(t, x) → I (t, x) mapping R∗+ × R into L2 ( ) is continuous;
(4) u satisfies (2.2) a.s., for all (t, x) ∈ R∗+ × R.

Notice that the random field is only defined for t > 0, which is natural since at
time t = 0, the solution is defined to be a measure.
According to property (3) in this definition, proving the existence of a random
field solution requires some estimates on its moments. On the other hand, if we
assume existence, then one can readily obtain moment formulas or bounds. Indeed,
consider for example, the parabolic Anderson model, and set

R EMARK 2.3 (Moment formula via the Fourier and Laplace transforms). If
we assume the existence of a random field solution, then under additional assumptions, one can also obtain the moment formula by using Fourier and Laplace
transforms. In particular, consider the case where ρ(u) = λu. Then f (t, x) =
E[u(t, x)2 ] satisfies equation (2.4). Assume that the double transform—the Fourier
transform in x and Laplace transform in t—of J02 (t, x) exists. Note that this assumption is rather strong: If the initial data has exponential growth, for example,
μ(dx) = eβ|x| dx with β > 0, then J0 (t, x) has two exponentially growing tails
[see (4.5)], and hence the Fourier transform of J02 (t, x) in x does not exist in the
sense of tempered distributions. Apply the Fourier transform in x and then the
Laplace transform in t on both sides of (2.4):

3. Proof of existence, uniqueness and moment estimates.
3.1. Some criteria for predictable random fields. A random field {Z(t, x)} is
called elementary if we can write Z(t, x) = Y 1]a,b] (t)1A (x), where 0 ≤ a < b,
A ⊂ R is an interval, and Y is an Fa -measurable random variable. A simple process
is a finite sum of elementary random fields. The set of simple processes generates
the predictable σ -field on R+ ×R× , denoted by P . For p ≥ 2 and X ∈ L2 (R+ ×
R, Lp ( )), set
(3.1)

X 2M,p :=

R∗+ ×R



X(s, y)2 ds dy < +∞.
p

When p = 2, we write X M instead of X M,2 . In [29], X dW is defined for
predictable X such that X M < +∞. However, the condition of predictability is
not always so easy to check, and as in the case of ordinary Brownian motion [7],
Chapter 3, it is convenient to be able to integrate elements X that are merely jointly
measurable and adapted. For this, let Pp denote the closure in L2 (R+ × R, Lp ( ))
of simple processes. Clearly, P2 ⊇ Pp ⊇ Pq for 2 ≤ p ≤ q < +∞, and according
to Itô’s isometry, X dW is well defined for all elements of P2 . The next proposition gives easily verifiable conditions for checking that X ∈ P2 .
P ROPOSITION 3.1. Suppose that for some t > 0 and p ∈ [2, +∞[, a random

(ii) X is jointly measurable with respect to B (]0, t[×R) × F ;

the space and time variables implies L ( )-continuity, thanks to the boundedness
n (·, ◦)1]0,t[ (·) ∈ P2 , for all

Since each X M (·, ◦)1]0,t[ (·) is bounded, satisfies (i), (ii) and (iii), and
X M (·, ◦)1]0,t[ (·) → X(·, ◦)1]0,t[ (·) in · M,2 as M → +∞ (by Lebesgue’s dominated convergence theorem), we conclude from step 2 that X(·, ◦)1]0,t[ (·) ∈ P2 .

Then for each (t, x) ∈ R+ × R, the random field (s, y) ∈ ]0, t[×R → G (t − s, x −

R EMARK 3.6. Similar estimates can be found in, for example, [28], Lemma 6.2, and [21], Theorem 6.7. The above is a slight improvement because all three
constants are best possible. Since the values of these constants are not essential
here, we refer to [6], Proposition 2.3.9, for the proof. Note that C1 = 1 was not
obtained in this reference, but with a slight change in the last lines of the proof
of [6], Proposition 2.3.9(i), the value C1 = 1 can be obtained, and this is optimal.
P ROOF OF P ROPOSITION 3.4. Fix (t, x) ∈ R∗+ × R. Clearly, X = (X(s, y),
(s, y) ∈ ]0, t[×R) with X(s, y) = Y (s, y)Gν (t − s, x − y) satisfies all conditions of
Proposition 3.1. This implies that for all (t, x) ∈ R∗+ × R, Y (·, ◦)Gν (t − ·, x − ◦) ∈
P2 . Hence w(t, x) is a well-defined Walsh integral and the resulting random field
is adapted to the filtration {Fs , s ≥ 0}.
Now we shall prove the Lp ( )-continuity. Fix (t, x) ∈ R∗+ × R. Let Bt,x and
a denote, respectively, the set and the constant defined in Proposition A.3. We

3.3. Proof of Theorem 2.4. We begin by stating two lemmas.
L EMMA 3.8. The solution (t, x) → J0 (t, x) to the homogeneous equation (2.1) with μ ∈ MH (R) is smooth: J0 ∈ C ∞ (R∗+ × R). If, in addition,
μ(dx) = f (x) dx, where f is continuous, then J0 ∈ C ∞ (R∗+ × R) ∩ C(R+ × R),
and if f is α-Hölder continuous, then J0 ∈ C ∞ (R∗+ × R) ∩ Cα/2,α (R+ × R).
P ROOF. The property J0 ∈ C ∞ (R∗+ × R) is a slight extension of standard
results (see [20], (1.14) on page 210). For more details, we refer the interested
reader to [6], Section 2.6. We only show here that J0 ∈ Cα/2,α (R+ × R) if
μ(dx) = f (x) dx and f is α-Hölder continuous. Fix (t, x) and (t  , x  ) ∈ R+ × R
with t  > t. By changing variables appropriately, we see that

Comparing the proofs of (3.12) and (3.13), we can see that (J02 K)(t, x) < ∞
if and only if (J02 L0 )(t, x) < ∞: the main issue is the integrability around t = 0
caused by the factor √1t in L0 .

continuous function over (t, x) ∈ R∗+ × R. We shall now apply Proposition 3.4
with Y = ρ(u0 ). We check the three properties that it requires. Properties (i) and
(ii) are trivially satisfied since Y is deterministic and continuous over R∗+ × R.
Property (iii) is also true since, by Lemma 3.7,

Define u1 (t, x) = J0 (t, x) + I1 (t, x). Since J0 (t, x) is continuous on R∗+ × R,
u1 (t, x) is Lp ( )-continuous on R∗+ × R. Now we estimate its moments. By Itô’s

The moments estimates (2.21), (2.23) and (2.25) can be obtained simply by
letting n → +∞ in the conclusions (3) and (4) of the previous step and using (2.5) and (2.18). Now let us prove the Lp ( )-continuity. For all a > 0, set

By (3.10), (3.13) and the continuity of (t, x) → J0∗ (2t, x) over R∗+ × R

u(t, x) from R∗+ × R into Lp ( ) is continuous over Ka since each un (t, x) is
so. As a can be arbitrarily large, we have then proved the Lp ( )-continuity of
(t, x) → u(t, x) over R∗+ × R.
The following inequality, which will be used in step 4, is a direct consequence
of the upper bound (4) of step 2 and (2.9):

Step 4 (Verifications). Now we shall verify that {u(t, x), (t, x) ∈ R∗+ × R} defined in the previous step is indeed a solution to the stochastic integral equation (2.2) in the sense of Definition 2.1. Clearly, u is adapted and jointlymeasurable, and hence it satisfies (1) and (2) of Definition 2.1. The continuity
of the function (t, x) → u(t, x) from R∗+ × R into L2 (R) proved in step 3, Proposition 3.4 applied to Y = ρ(un ) and (3.19) imply (3) of Definition 2.1. So we only
need to verify that u satisfies (4) of Definition 2.1, that is, u(t, x) satisfies (2.2)
a.s., for all (t, x) ∈ R∗+ × R.
We shall apply Proposition 3.4 with Y (s, y) = ρ(u(s, y)) by verifying the three
properties that it requires. Properties (i) and (ii) are satisfied by (1) and (2) in
the conclusion part of step 3. Property (iii) is also true since, by Lemma 3.7 and
also (3.19),

Furthermore, by the last part of Proposition 3.4, (t, x) → I (t, x) is Lp ( )continuous, since by conclusion (2) of step 3, (t, x) → u(t, x) is Lp ( )continuous.
By step 3,

[0,t]×R



Gν (t − s, x − y)ρ un−1 (s, y) W (ds, dy)

with un (t, x) converging to u(t, x) in Lp ( ). We only need to show that the righthand side converges in Lp ( ) to J0 (t, x) + I (t, x). In fact, by Lemma 3.3,

and by step 3, the same upper bound applies to u(s, y) 2p . Finally, by Lemma 3.9
and (2.9), the above upper bound, multiplied by G2ν (t − s, x − y), is integrable
over [0, t] × R. This finishes the proof of the existence part of Theorem 2.4 with
the moment estimates.
Step 5 (Uniqueness). Let u and v be two solutions to (2.2) (in the sense
of Definition 2.1) with the same initial data, and denote w(t, x) := u(t, x) −
v(t, x). The L2 ( )-continuity—property (3) of Definition 2.1—guarantees that
both (t, x) → u(t, x) and (t, x) → v(t, x) are L2 ( )-continuous since (t, x) →
J0 (t, x) is continuous by Lemma 3.8. Then w(t, x) is well defined and the function (t, x) → w(t, x) is L2 ( )-continuous. Writing w(t, x) explicitly and then
taking the second moment, by Itô’s isometry and the Lipschitz condition on ρ, we
have

 

E w(t, x)2 ≤ E w2

where L∗0 (t, x) := L0 (t, x; ν, Lipρ ).

Now we convolve both sides with respect to K∗ (t, x) := K(t, x; ν, Lipρ ) and
use (2.9) to obtain

So (E[w2 ] L∗0 )(t, x) ≡ 0, which implies by (3.20) that E[w(t, x)2 ] = 0 for all
(t, x) ∈ R∗+ × R. Therefore, we conclude that for all (t, x) ∈ R∗+ × R, u(t, x) =
v(t, x) a.s.
Step 6 (Two-point correlations). In this last step, we prove the properties (2.22),
(2.24) and (2.26) of the two-point correlation function. Let u(t, x) be the solution to (2.2). Fix τ ≥ t ∈ R∗+ and x, y ∈ R. Consider the L2 ( )-martingale
{U (s; t, x), s ∈ [0, t]} defined by
U (s; t, x) := J0 (t, x) +





Gν (t − r, x − z)ρ u(r, z) W (dr, dz).

Then U (t; t, x) = u(t, x) and E[U (s; t, x)] = J0 (t, x). Similarly, we define the
martingale {U (s; τ, y), s ∈ [0, τ ]}. The mutual variation process of these two martingales is, for all s ∈ [0, t],

get

to top are Ea,β (x) with the parameter a ranging from 1 to 6 for Figure 1(a) and from 6 to 1 for
Figure 1(b), which are representative of the cases β > 0 and β < 0, respectively. The parameter β
controls the asymptotic behavior near infinity while both a and β determine how the function eβ|x|
is smoothed at zero. The smaller a is, the closer Ea,β (0) is to 1.

the expression in (2.33) follows from Theorem 2.12 since μ ∈ MG,+ (R), for
any β  < β. We now establish the corresponding lower bound on λ(2). Set

Hence, for all x ∈ R, then the function a → Ea,β (x) is nondecreasing for β > 0
and nonincreasing for β < 0.
P ROOF. (i) Is trivial. (ii) Follows from a direct calculation. (iii) Is routine.
We now prove (iv). Suppose that β < 0. We first prove the upper bound. Since
x → Ea,β (x) is an even function, we shall only consider x ≥ 0. We need to show
that for x ≥ 0

Then the lower bound follows from the fact that e−2|βx| ≥ Ea,2β (x). As for the
first part of (iv) where β > 0, the upper bound holds since (·) < 1. The lower
bound is a consequence of the upper bound with β < 0 and the equality Ea,β (x) =
