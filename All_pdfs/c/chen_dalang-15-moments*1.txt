Abstract We study the nonlinear fractional stochastic heat equation in the spatial
domain R driven by space-time white noise. The initial condition is taken to be a
measure on R, such as the Dirac delta function, but this measure may also have
non-compact support. Existence and uniqueness, as well as upper and lower bounds
on all pth moments ( p ≥ 2), are obtained. These bounds are uniform in the spatial variable, which answers an open problem mentioned in Conus and Khoshnevisan
(Probab Theory Relat Fields 152(3–4):681–701, 2012). We improve the weak intermittency statement by Foondun and Khoshnevisan (Electron J Probab 14(21):548–568,
2009), and we show that the growth indices (of linear type) introduced in Conus and
Khoshnevisan (Probab Theory Relat Fields 152(3–4):681–701, 2012) are infinite. We
introduce the notion of “growth indices of exponential type” in order to characterize
the manner in which high peaks propagate away from the origin, and we show that the
presence of a fractional differential operator leads to significantly different behavior
compared with the standard stochastic heat equation.

1 Introduction
In this paper, we consider the following nonlinear fractional stochastic heat equation:

⎨ ∂ − D a u(t, x) = ρ (u(t, x)) Ẇ (t, x), t ∈ R∗ := ]0, +∞[, x ∈ R,

(1.1)
⎩
u(0, ◦) = μ(◦),
where a ∈ ]0, 2] is the order of the fractional differential operator x Dδa and δ (|δ| ≤
a ∧ (2 − a) := min(a, 2 − a)) is its skewness, Ẇ is the space-time white noise, μ is the
initial data (a measure), the function ρ : R → R is Lipschitz continuous, and ◦ denotes
the spatial dummy variable. The definition and properties of the fractional differential
operator x Dδa are recalled in Sect. 2.1. This equation falls into a class of equations
studied by Debbi and Dozzi [12,13]. According to [11, Theorem 11], even the linear
form of (1.1) (ρ ≡ 1) does not have a solution if a ≤ 1, so they consider a ∈ ]1, 2]. If
we focus on deterministic initial conditions, then in the setting of (1.1), they proved in
[13, Theorem 1] that there is a unique random field solution if μ has a bounded density.
Equation (1.1) is of particular interest since it is an extension of the classical parabolic Anderson model [5], in which a = 2 and δ = 0, so x Dδa is the operator ∂ 2 /∂ x 2 ,
and ρ(u) = λu is a linear function. Foondun and Khoshnevisan [15] considered problem (1.1) with the operator x Dδa replaced by the L 2 (R)-generator L of a Lévy process.
They proved the existence of a random field solution under the assumption that the initial data μ has a bounded and nonnegative density. In [9], the operator x Dδa is replaced
by the generator of a symmetric Lévy process and the authors prove that μ can be
any finite Borel measure on R. Recently, Balan and Conus [1,2] studied the Anderson
model with fractional Laplacian and bounded initial condition, and with Gaussian,
spatially homogeneous noise that behaves in time like a fractional Brownian motion
with Hurst index H > 1/2.
Following the approach of [6], in which the case a = 2 and δ = 0 was considered,
we begin by extending the above results (for the operator x Dδa ) to allow a wider class
of initial data: Let M (R) be the set of signed Borel measures on R. From the Jordan decomposition, μ = μ+ − μ− where μ± are two non-negative Borel measures
with disjoint support, and denote |μ| = μ+ + μ− . Then our admissible initial data is
μ ∈ Ma (R), where



Ma (R) := μ ∈ M(R) : sup

< +∞ , for a ∈ ]1, 2].
1+|x−y|1+a

We will also use the set Ma,+ (R) = {μ ∈ Ma (R) : μ is non negative}. For
μ ∈ Ma (R), we obtain estimates for the moments E(|u(t, x)| p ) for all p ≥ 2.
These estimates have the same structure as those that are given in [6, Theorem 2.4],
but the kernel K that appears in this reference has quite different properties than those
of the kernel K that appears in relation with Eq. (1.1): see Sect. 3.2.

Let us define the upper and lower Lyapunov exponents of order p by

log E |u(t, x)| p , m p (x) := lim inf log E |u(t, x)| p ,
t→+∞ t
t→+∞ t
(1.2)

m p (x) := lim sup

for all p ≥ 2 and x ∈ R. If the initial data is constant, then m p and m p do not depend
on x. In this case, the solution is called fully intermittent if m 2 > 0 and m 1 = 0 by
Carmona and Molchanov [5, Definition III.1.1, on p. 55]. For a detailed discussion
of the meaning of this intermittency property, see [17]. Informally, it means that the
sample paths of u(t, x) exhibit “high peaks” separated by “large valleys”.
Foondun and Khoshnevisan proved weak intermittency in [15], namely, for all
p ≥ 2,
m 2 (x) > 0, and m p (x) < +∞ for all x ∈ R,
under the conditions that μ(dx) = f (x)dx with inf x∈R f (x) > 0 and inf x =0 |ρ(x)/x| >
0. We improve this result by showing in Theorem 3.4 that when 1 < a < 2, |δ| < 2 − a
(strict inequality) and μ ∈ Ma (R) is nonnegative and nonvanishing, then for all
p ≥ 2,
inf m p (x) > 0, and sup m p (x) < +∞.

x∈R

For this, we need a growth condition on ρ, namely, that for some constants lρ > 0
and ς ≥ 0,
ρ(x)2 ≥ l 2ρ ς 2 +x 2 ,

for all x ∈ R.

(1.3)

In a forthcoming paper [8], this weak intermittency property will be extended to full
intermittency by showing in addition that m 1 (x) ≡ 0.
Our result answers an open problem stated by Conus and Khoshnevisan [10].
Indeed, for the case of the fractional Laplacian, which corresponds to our setting
with a ∈ ]1, 2[ and δ = 0, they ask whether the function t → supx∈R E |u(t, x)|2
has exponential growth in t for initial data with exponential decay. Our answer is “yes”
under the condition (1.3). In addition, under these conditions, if μ ∈ Ma,+ (R) and
μ = 0, then for fixed x ∈ R, the function t → E |u(t, x)|2 has at least exponential
growth; see Remark 3.5.
We define the following growth indices of exponential type:

e( p) := sup α > 0 : lim


log E |u(t, x)| p > 0 ,

(1.4)

sup

log E |u(t, x)| p < 0 ,

(1.5)

t→∞ t |x|≥exp(αt)

e( p) := inf α > 0 : lim

1

t→∞ t |x|≥exp(αt)

in order to give a proper characterization of the propagation speed of “high peaks”. This
concept is discussed in Conus and Khoshnevisan [10]. These authors define analogous

123

Stoch PDE: Anal Comp (2015) 3:360–397

363

indices λ( p) and λ( p), in which |x| ≥ exp(αt) is replaced by |x| ≥ αt, which we call
growth indices of linear type.
Conus and Khoshnevisan [10] consider the case where x Dδa is replaced by the
generator L of a real-valued symmetric Lévy process (X t , t ≥ 0). They showed in
[10, Theorem 1.1 and Remark 1.2] that if the initial data μ is a nonnegative lower
semicontinuous function with certain exponential decay at infinity, and if X 1 has
exponential moments, then
0 < λ( p) ≤ λ( p) < +∞, for all p ∈ [2, +∞) .
For example, a Lévy process that satisfies this assumption is the “truncated symmetric
stable process”.
Among Lévy processes, stable processes constitute an important subclass with a
self-similarity property. Infinitesimal generators of these processes are not covered
by the results of [10], since even the second moment of X 1 does not exists. It turns
out that the fractional differential operator x Dδa is the infinitesimal generator of a (not
necessarily symmetric) strictly stable process with a ∈ ]1, 2] (see Sect. 2.1), and we
will see that when 1 < a < 2, the presence of the fractional differential operator x Dδa
in (1.1) leads to significantly different behaviors of the speed of propagation of high
peaks, compared to that obtained in [10].
Indeed, we show first that if the initial data has sufficiently rapid decay at ±∞, then
e( p) < ∞ (see (3.22) and (3.23)). Then we show that if 1 < a < 2 and |δ| < 2 − a
(meaning that the underlying stable process has both positive and negative jumps),
then
e( p) > 0, for all p ∈ [2, +∞) and μ ∈ Ma,+ (R), μ = 0,

(1.6)

provided ρ satisfies condition (1.3). This conclusion applies, for instance, to the case
where the initial data μ is the Dirac delta function. In particular, for well-localized
initial data (for instance, μ ≥ 0 and R |y|η μ(dy) < ∞ for some η > 0), 0 < e( p) ≤
e( p) < +∞, whereas for initial data that is bounded below (μ(d x) = f (x)d x with
f (x) > c > 0, for all x ∈ R), e( p) = e( p) = +∞. See Theorem 3.6 for the precise
statements. As a direct consequence, λ( p) = λ( p) = +∞ for all p ∈ [2, ∞[.
The structure of this paper is as follows. After defining the operator x Dδa and giving
the meaning of (1.1) in Sect. 2, the main results are presented in Sect. 3: Existence
and general bounds are given in Theorem 3.1. These bounds are expressed in terms of
the kernel K mentioned above, for which explicit upper and lower bounds are given.
These lead to our results on weak intermittency (Theorem 3.4) and growth indices
(Theorem 3.6). Section 4 contains the proof of Theorem 3.1 and Sect. 5 presents the
proofs of Theorems 3.4 and 3.6.

2 Preliminaries and notation
We begin by defining the differential operator x Dδa that appears in the spde (1.1), then
we shall give the rigorous meaning of the spde.

2.1 The Riesz–Feller fractional derivative

Let F f (ξ ) = R dx e−iξ x f (x) denote the Fourier transform. For 0 < a ≤ 2 and
|δ| ≤ min(a, 2 − a), the Riesz–Feller fractional derivative x Dδa f of a smooth and
integrable function f is defined (see [19, (2.2)]) by
F(x Dδa f )(ξ ) = δ ψa (ξ ) F f (ξ ),

where δ ψa (ξ ) = −|ξ |a exp(−iπ δ sgn(ξ )/2).
(2.1)
2

When a = 2 (and therefore δ = 0), this is simply the ordinary second derivative ddx 2 .
For 1 < a < 2 and δ ≤ 2 − a, which is the case that we are most interested in, as
stated in [19, (2.8)] (in which integrals are understood in the sense of Cauchy principle
values), this is equivalent to the more explicit formula

and (z) = 0 e−t t z−1 dt is Euler’s Gamma function [21]. Indeed, taking the Fourier
transform of the right-hand side of (2.2) leads to (2.1) by (2.3) below and elementary
properties of Fourier transform.
From the point of view of a probabilist, the operator x Dδa is the infinitesimal generator of a strictly a-stable Lévy process X = (X t , t ≥ 0) (where “strictly” refers to
the fact that the process is centered: see [23, Chapter 3]), with Lévy measure

Indeed, the general form of the infinitesimal generator of X , given in terms of its Lévy

where F −1 is the inverse Fourier transform. This is (one way to represent) the density of the strictly a-stable random variable X t with Lévy measure tνa , as given in
the representation (C) in [27, p. 17]. For comparison, the expression in [23, Theorem 14.15] corresponds to the representation (A) in [27, p. 9]. For strictly stable laws,
in particular the case 1 < a < 2, these two representations are equivalent: see [27,
(I.28),(I.26) and Theorem C.3]. Properties of δ G a will be given in Lemma 4.1 below.
We refer to [19] for more details on these fractional differential operators.

where “∗” denotes the convolution in the space variable.
2.2 The stochastic pde
Let W = {Wt (A), A ∈ Bb (R), t ≥ 0} be a space-time white noise defined on a probability space (, F, P), where Bb (R) is the collection of Borel sets with finite Lebesgue
measure. Let (Ft , t ≥ 0) be the filtration generated by W and augmented by the σ -field
N generated by all P-null sets in F:
Ft = σ (Ws (A) : 0 ≤ s ≤ t, A ∈ Bb (R)) ∨ N , t ≥ 0.

123

366

Stoch PDE: Anal Comp (2015) 3:360–397

In the following, we fix this filtered probability space {, F, (Ft , t ≥ 0), P}. We
use ||·|| p to denote the L p ()-norm ( p ≥ 1). With
 this setup, W becomes a worthy
martingale measure in the sense of Walsh [25], and [0,t]×R X (s, y)W (ds, dy) is welldefined in this reference for a suitable class of random fields {X (s, y), (s, y) ∈ R+ ×R}.
The rigorous meaning of the spde (1.1) uses the integral formulation
u(t, x) = J0 (t, x) + I (t, x), where

I (t, x) =
δ G a (t − s, x − y) ρ (u(s, y)) W (ds, dy).

(2.5)

[0,t]×R

Definition 2.1 A process u = u(t, x), (t, x) ∈ R∗+ × R is called a random field
solution to (1.1) if:
(1) u is adapted, i.e., for all (t, x) ∈ R∗+ × R, u(t, x) is Ft -measurable;
(2) u is jointly measurable with respect to B R∗+ × R × F;
(3) δ G a2  ||ρ(u)||22 (t, x) < +∞ for all (t, x) ∈ R∗+ × R, where “” denotes the

(4) For all (t, x) ∈ R∗+ × R, u(t, x) satisfies (2.5) a.s.;
(5) The function (t, x) → I (t, x) mapping R∗+ × R into L 2 () is continuous.
Assume that the function ρ : R → R is globally Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant Lipρ > 0. This implies a growth condition on ρ: for some constants
L ρ > 0 and ς ≥ 0,
ρ(x)2 ≤ L 2ρ ς 2 +x 2 ,

for all x ∈ R.

(2.6)

√
Note that one can take ς = |ρ(0)| and L ρ ≤ 2 Lipρ (and the inequality may even
be strict). We shall also specially consider the linear case ρ(u) = λu with λ = 0,
which is related to the parabolic Anderson model (a = 2). It is a special case of the
following near-linear growth condition: for some constant ς ≥ 0,
ρ(x)2 = λ2 ς 2 +x 2 ,

for all x ∈ R .

For all (t, x) ∈ R∗+ × R, n ∈ N and λ ∈ R, define

(the convergence of this series is established in Proposition 3.2). For t ≥ 0, define
H(t; λ) := (1  K(·, ◦; λ)) (t, x)
(notice that the right-hand side does not depend on x).
Let z p be the universal constant in the Burkholder-Davis-Gundy inequality (in

particular, z 2 = 1), and so z p ≤ 2 p for all p ≥ 2; see [4, Appendix]. Define

3 Main results
3.1 Existence, uniqueness and moments
The following theorem extends the result of [6, Theorem 2.4] from a = 2 to a ∈ ]1, 2].
In view of the related result [7, Theorem 2.3] and Remark 2.4 in this reference, the
bounds in this theorem are not a surprise, though they do require a proof. The main
effort will be to turn these abstract bounds into concrete estimates, via explicit upper
and lower bounds on the functions K and H (see Sect. 3.2). For τ ≥ t > 0 and
x, y ∈ R, define

ga (t, x) :=

3.3 Growth indices and weak intermittency
Theorem 3.4 (Weak intermittency) Suppose that a ∈ ]1, 2] and |δ| ≤ 2 − a.
(1) If ρ satisfies (2.6) and μ ∈ Ma (R), then for all even integers p ≥ 2,
sup m p (x) ≤

x∈R

p 2+1/(a−1) .

(3.21)

(2) Suppose ρ satisfies (1.3), |δ| < 2 − a (strict inequality) and μ ∈ Ma,+ (R). If
either μ = 0 or ς = 0, then for all p ≥ 2,
inf m p (x) ≥

x∈R

p
a∗
ϒ l ρ , a, δ
> 0.
2

Note that if a = 2, then (3.21) implies that for some constant C, we have m p ≤ C p 3 ,
which recovers previous analyses (see [3], [6, Example 2.7], etc).
Remark 3.5 Fix p ≥ 2. Clearly, Theorem 3.4 implies that for all x ∈ R,

t→∞

Hence, the function t → sup y∈R E (|u(t, y)| p ) has at least exponential growth. This
answers the second open problem stated by Conus and Khoshnevisan in [10]. Moreover, Theorem 3.4 implies that for all fixed x ∈ R, the function t → E (|u(t, x)| p )
also has at least exponential growth.
Recall the definitions of the constants 
γ p and ϒ(l ρ , a, δ) in (3.11) and (3.17),
respectively.
Theorem 3.6 (Growth indices)
(1) Suppose that a ∈ ]1, 2], |δ| ≤ 2 − a and ρ satisfies (2.6) with ς = 0. If there are
C < ∞, α > 0 and β > 0 such that for all (t, x) ∈ [1, ∞[ ×R,
|J0 (t, x)| ≤ C(1 + t α )(1 + |x|)−β ,

(3.22)

then
e( p) ≤

(3.23)


In particular, if, for some η > 0, R |μ|(dy)(1 + |y|η ) < ∞, then (3.22) and
(3.23) are satisfied with β = min(η, 1 + a).

(2) Suppose that a ∈ ]1, 2[ (note that a = 2), |δ| < 2 − a (strict inequality) and ρ
satisfies (1.3). For all μ ∈ Ma,+ (R), μ = 0 and all p ≥ 2, if ς = 0, then
ϒ l ρ , a, δ

For these μ, if ς = 0 and there is c > 0 such that
J0 (t, x) ≥ c,

for all (t, x) ∈ R+ × R,

(3.24)

or if ς = 0, then e( p) = e( p) = +∞. In particular, λ( p) = λ( p) = +∞ for
all p ≥ 2, and a sufficient condition for (3.24) is that μ(d x) = f (x)d x with
f (x) ≥ c, for all x ∈ R.
The two theorems above are proved in Sect. 5.
Remark 3.7 In the case of the classical parabolic Anderson model, in which a = 2,
δ = 0 and ρ(u) = λu, it was shown in [6] that λ(2) = λ(2) = λ2 /2 when the initial
data has compact support (for instance). Here, it is natural to ask whether e( p) = e( p)
when ρ(u) = λu, for instance for initial data with compact support. This remains an
open question.

4 Proof of Theorem 3.1
We need some technical results. The proof of Theorem 3.1 will be presented at the
end of this section.
The Green functions defined in (2.4) are densities of stable random variables. Some
key properties are stated in the next lemma. Recall that a probability density function
f : R → R+ is called bell-shaped if f is infinitely differentiable and its k-th derivative
f (k) has exactly k zeros in its support for all k.
Lemma 4.1 For a ∈ ]0, 2], the following properties hold:
(i) For fixed t > 0, the function δ G a (t, ·) is a bell-shaped density function. In
particular, R δ G a (t, x)dx = 1.
(ii) The unique mode is located on the positive semi-axis x > 0 if δ > 0, on the
negative semi-axis x < 0 if δ < 0, and at x = 0 if δ = 0.
(iii) δ G a (t, x) satisfies the semigroup property, i.e., for 0 < s < t,
δ G a (t + s, x) = ( δ G a (t, ◦) ∗ δ G a (s, ◦))(x).

(iv)

δ G a (t, x) has the following scaling property: For all n ≥ 0,

(4.3)
(vii) limt↓0 δ G a (t, x) = δ0 (x), where δ0 (x) is the Dirac delta function with unit mass
at zero.
Proof Most of these properties appear in several books [18,24,27]. We refer the interested readers to [13, Lemma 1] for Properties (i) (except the bell-shaped density),
(iii) and (iv). Formula (v) can be found in [18], (5.9.3) in Sects. 5.9 and (5.8.6) in
Sect. 5.8; for x → −∞, use (5.8.2c) in this reference (note that the formula in [13,
Lemma 1(vii)] is not quite correct for x → −∞). The proof that the density is bellshaped is due to Gawronski [16]. Property (ii) can be found in the summary part of
[27, Sect. 2.7, p. 143–147].
Now we prove (vi). Property (4.2) follows from [13, Corollary 1]. By the scaling
property (4.1) and (4.2),

exp ( δ ψa (ξ )t) → 1 as t ↓ 0. This completes the proof of Lemma 4.1.

Let Ln (t, x; λ), K(t, x; λ), and  = δ a be defined in (2.8), (2.9), and (3.10),
respectively. Recall that 1/a + 1/a ∗ = 1.
Lemma 4.2 (Theorem 1.3 p. 32 in [22]) If 0 < α < 2, β is an arbitrary complex

(iii) For all t > 0 and λ > 0, the series n=1 Ln (t, x; λ) converges uniformly over

which completes the proof of the Lemma 4.7.
The following proposition is useful to prove the L p ()–continuity of I (t, x).

Proposition 4.8 Suppose that a ∈ ]1, 2] and |δ| ≤ 2 −a. Fix (t, x) ∈ R∗+ × R. Denote
+
,
B := Bt,x = (t , x ) ∈ R∗+ × R : 0 ≤ t ≤ t + 1/2, |x − x | ≤ 1 .
Then there exists a constant A > 0 such that for all (t , x ) ∈ B, s ∈ [0, t [ and
|y| ≥ A,
δ Ga

t − s, x − y ≤ −δ G a (t + 1 − s, x − y) + δ G a (t + 1 − s, x − y).

Proof The case where a = 2 is proved in [6, Proposition A.3], so we only need to
prove the case where 1 < a < 2. Denote F(t, x) := δ G a (t, x)+ −δ G a (t, x). Suppose
the mode of the density δ G a (1, x) is located at m ∈ R. By the scaling property, the
mode of the density δ G a (t, x) is located at t 1/a m. Hence, when x ≥ t 1/a |m| (resp.
x ≤ −t 1/a |m|), the function x → F(t, x) is decreasing (resp. increasing).

Fix (t, x) ∈ R∗+ × R. Assume that |y − x| > 1 + (t + 1/2)1/a |m|. From the above
observation, we deduce that for all (t , x ) ∈ B,
δ Ga

t − s, x − y ≤ F t − s, |y − x| − |x − x | ≤ F t − s, |y − x| − 1 .

Because |δ| ≤ 2 − a and a ∈ ]1, 2[ , we see that sin(πa/2) cos(π δ/2) = 0. Hence,

F (t − s, |y − x| − 1)

(x) = 1. Consider the case n = 1 and
if n = 0, then it is trivially true, with P0


Proof of Theorem 3.1 The proof follows the same six steps as those in the proof of [6,
Theorem 2.4] with some minor changes:
(1) Both proofs rely on estimates on the kernel function K(t, x). Instead of an explicit
formula as for the heat equation case (see [6, Proposition 2.2]), Proposition 3.2
ensures the finiteness and provides a bound on the kernel function K(t, x).
(2) In the Picard iteration scheme (i.e., Steps 1–4 in the proof of [6, Theorem 2.4]),
we need to check the L p ()-continuity of the stochastic integral, which then
guarantees that at the next step, the integrand is again in P2 , via [6, Proposition 3.4].
Here, the statement of [6, Proposition 3.4] is still true by replacing in its proof
[6, Propositions 3.5 and A.3] by Propositions 4.4 and 4.8, respectively. Note
that when applying Proposition 4.8, we need to replace the G 2ν in [6, (3.8)] by
( −δ G a + δ G a )2 ≤ 2 −δ G a2 + 2 δ G a2 .
(3) In the first step of the Picard iteration scheme, the following property is useful:
For all compact sets K ⊆ R+ × R,
sup

(t,x)∈K



1 + J02  δ G a2 (t, x) < +∞.

For the heat equation, this property is discussed in [6, Lemma 3.9]. Here, Lemma
4.10 gives the desired result with minimal requirements on the initial data. This
property, together with the calculation of the upper bound on the function K in
Proposition 3.2, guarantees (as in [6, Lemmas 3.3 and 3.7]) that all the L p ()moments of u(t, x) are finite. This property is also used to establish uniform
convergence of the Picard iteration scheme, hence L p ()–continuity of (t, x) →
I (t, x).

The proofs of (3.1)–(3.4) are identical to those of the corresponding properties in [6,

This completes the proof of Theorem 3.1.

5.1 Lower bound on K(t, x) (Proposition 3.3)
We need some properties of ga (t, x) defined in (3.15).
&a,δ defined
Lemma 5.1 Suppose that a ∈ ]1, 2[ and |δ| < 2 − a. Then the constant C
in (3.16) is strictly positive, and so for all t > 0 and x ∈ R,

Let f (y) = δ G a (1, y)/ga (1, y). In the case where 1 < a < 2 and |δ| < 2 − a, both
δ G a (1, y) and ga (1, y) have tails at ±∞ with polynomial decay of the same rate as
|y|−1−a : see [27, p. 143] (we use here the fact that |δ| = 2 − a). Since y → δ G a (t, y)
is unimodal (see [18, Lemma 5.10.1]), we conclude that f (y) > 0 for all y ∈ R, and
that lim y→±∞ f (y) > 0 . Therefore, inf y∈R f (y) > 0, and this completes the proof
of Lemma 5.1.

real-valued, instead of complex-valued, which allows us to bound this transform from

away from zero, where h(u) := u ν eu K ν (u). By the differential formula for x ±ν K ν (x)
(see, for instance, [20, 51:10:4, p. 532]),
h (u) = eu u ν (K ν (u) − K ν−1 (u)).
By the integral representation of K ν (z) in [21, 10.32.9, p. 252],
K ν (u) − K ν−1 (u) =

In the next lemma, we gather some properties of the function ga (t, x).
Lemma 5.3 (1) For a > 0 and t > 0, ga (t, x − y) ≥ π 2−(a+1) t 1/a ga (t, x)ga (t, y).
(2) For t > 0 and z ∈ R, F[ga2 (t, ·)](z) ≥ Ca+1/2 π −2 t −1/a exp(−t 1/a |z|).

where the constant Ca+1/2 is defined in (3.18).
(4) For t ≥ r ≥ t/2 > 0, ga (r, x) ≥ (t/r )1/a 2−1−1/a ga (t, x).
Proof (1) Because 1+(u −v)2 ≤ 1+2u 2 +2v 2 ≤ (1+2u 2 )(1+2v 2 ), ga (t, x − y) is

bounded from below by π t 1/a ga t, 2 x ga t, 2 y . Then use the inequality

same lower bound as (5.10). Note that this lower bound does not depend on x. This
proves the statement (2) with p = 2. For p > 2, we use Hölder’s inequality



2/ p
E |u(t, x)|2 ≤ E |u(t, x)| p
.
Hence, m p (x) ≥ 2p m 2 (x). This completes the proof of Theorem 3.4.
