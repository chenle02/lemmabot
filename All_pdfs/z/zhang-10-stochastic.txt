Abstract
In this paper, we study the existence-uniqueness and large deviation estimate for stochastic Volterra
integral equations with singular kernels in 2-smooth Banach spaces. Then we apply them to a large class
of semilinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE), and obtain the existence of unique maximal
strong solutions (in the sense of SDE and PDE) under local Lipschitz conditions. Moreover, stochastic
Navier–Stokes equations are also investigated.

1. Introduction
The aims of this paper are three folds: First of all, we prove the existence and uniqueness of
solutions with continuous paths for stochastic Volterra integral equations with singular kernels
in a 2-smooth Banach space. Secondly, the large deviation principles (abbrev. LDP) of Freidlin–
Wentzell’s type for stochastic Volterra equations are established under small perturbations of
multiplicative noises. Thirdly, we apply them to several classes of semilinear stochastic partial
differential equations (abbrev. SPDE). Compared with the well-known results on SPDEs, the
main contributions of the present paper are that we can prove the existence and uniqueness of
strong solutions (in the sense of SDE and PDE) for SPDEs, and give a unified treatment for the
LDPs to a large class of SPDEs.
In finite-dimensional space, stochastic Volterra integral equations with regular kernels and
driven by Brownian motions were first studied by Berger and Mizel [3]. Later, Protter [52] studied stochastic Volterra equations driven by general semimartingales. Using the Skorohod integral,
Pardoux and Protter [47] also investigated stochastic Volterra equations with anticipating coefficients. The study of stochastic Volterra equations with singular kernels can be found in [14,16,
65,36,44], etc. Recently, the present author [68] studied the approximation of Euler’s type and
the LDP of Freidlin–Wentzell’s type for stochastic Volterra equations with singular kernels. In
particular, the kernels in [68] can be used to deal with fractional Brownian motion kernels as
well as fractional order integral kernels. The study of LDP for stochastic Volterra equations is
also referred to [44,36].
Since the work of Freidlin and Wentzell [21], the theory of small perturbation large deviations
for stochastic differential equations (abbrev. SDE) has been studied extensively (cf. [2,62], etc.).
In the classical method, to establish such an LDP for SDE, one usually needs to discretize the
time variable and then prove various necessary exponential continuity and tightness for approximation equations in different spaces by using comparison principle. However, such verifications
would become rather complicated and even impossible in some cases, e.g., stochastic evolution
equations with multiplicative noises.
Recently, Dupuis and Ellis [19] systematically developed a weak convergence approach to the
theory of large deviation. The central idea is to prove some variational representation formula for
the Laplace transform of bounded continuous functionals, which will lead to proving a Laplace
principle which is equivalent to the LDP. In particular, for Brownian functionals, an elegant vari-

X. Zhang / Journal of Functional Analysis 258 (2010) 1361–1425

1363

ational representation formula has been established by Boué and Dupuis [5] and Budhiraja and
Dupuis [10]. A simplified proof was given by the present author [67]. This variational representation has already been proved to be very effective for various finite and infinite-dimensional
stochastic dynamical systems even with irregular coefficients (cf. [54,55,11,68,56], etc.). One
of the main advantages of this argument is that one only needs to make some simple moment
estimates (see Section 4 below).
On the other hand, it is well known that in the deterministic case, many PDE problems of
parabolic and hyperbolic types can be written as Volterra type integral equations in Banach
spaces by using the corresponding semigroup and the variation-of-constants formula (cf. [22,
28,48]). An obvious merit of this procedure is that the unbounded operators in PDEs no longer
appear and the analysis is entirely analogous to the ODE case. Thus, one naturally expects to take
the same advantages for SPDEs in Banach spaces. However, it is not all Banach spaces in which
stochastic integrals are well defined. One can only work in a class of 2-smooth Banach spaces.
The definition of stochastic integrals in 2-smooth Banach spaces and related properties such as
Burkholder–Davis–Gundy’s (abbrev. BDG) inequality, Girsanov’s theorem, stochastic Fubini’s
theorem and the distribution of stochastic integrals can be found in [43,6,7,45], etc. Thus, similar to the deterministic case, we can develop a parallel theory in 2-smooth Banach spaces for
SPDEs. It should be emphasized that besides the usual SPDEs driven by multiplicative Brownian
noises, a class of stochastic evolutionary integral equations appearing in viscoelasticity and heat
conduction with memory (cf. [53]) can also be written as abstract stochastic Volterra equations
in Banach spaces.
In the past three decades, the theory of general SPDEs has been developed extensively
by numerous authors mainly based on two different approaches: semigroup method based on
the variation-of-constants formula (cf. [64,15,6–8,66], etc.) and variation method based on
Galerkin’s finite-dimensional approximation (cf. [46,35,58,34,41,51,69,26], etc.). A new regularization method is given in [71]. An overview for the classification and applications of SPDEs
are referred to the recent book of Kotelenez [33]. In the author’s knowledge, most of the wellknown results are primarily concentrated on the mild or weak solutions, even measure-valued
solutions. Such notions of solutions naturally appear in the study of SPDEs driven by the space–
time white noises, and in this case one cannot obtain any differentiability of solutions with respect
to the spatial variable.
Nevertheless, when one considers an SPDE driven by the spatial regular and time white noises,
it is reasonable to require the existence of spatial regular solutions or classical solutions in the
sense of PDE. For linear SPDEs, such regular solutions are relatively easy and well known (cf.
[35,58,20], etc.). However, for non-linear SPDEs, there seems to be few results (cf. [34,39,67,
71]). A major difficulty to prove the spatial regularity of solutions is that one cannot use the
usual bootstrap method in the theory of PDE since there is no differentiability of solutions with
respect to the time variable. The present author [67] solved this problem by using a non-linear
interpolation result due to Tartar [63]. Obviously, for the regularity theory of SPDEs, by using
Sobolev’s embedding theorem (cf. [1]), it is natural to consider the Lp -solutions of SPDEs. This
is also why we need to work in 2-smooth Banach spaces. It should be noticed that the Lp -theory
for SPDEs has been established in [6–8,34,17,18,66], etc. But, there are few results to deal with
the Lp -strong solution in the sense of PDE. In the present paper, we shall prove a general result
about the existence of strong solutions in the sense of both SDE and PDE (see Theorem 6.6
below).
We now describe the structure of this paper: In Section 2, we prepare some preliminaries for
later use, and divide it into three subsections. In Section 2.1, we prove a Gronwall’s lemma of

1364

X. Zhang / Journal of Functional Analysis 258 (2010) 1361–1425

Volterra type under rather weak assumptions on kernel functions. Moreover, two simple examples
are provided to show this lemma. In Section 2.2, we recall the Itô integral in 2-smooth Banach
spaces and Burkholder–Davies–Gundy’s inequality as well as Kolmogorov’s continuity criterion
of random fields in random intervals. In Section 2.3, we recall a criterion of Laplace principle
established by Budhiraja and Dupuis [5,10] (see also [70]).
In Section 3, using the Gronwall inequality of Volterra type in Section 2.1, we first prove
the existence and uniqueness of solutions for stochastic Volterra equations in 2-smooth Banach
spaces under global Lipschitz conditions and singular kernels. Next, in Section 3.2, we study the
regularity of solutions under slightly stronger assumptions on kernels. Moreover, a BDG type of
inequality for stochastic Volterra type integral is also proved. In Section 3.3, employing the usual
localizing method, we prove the existence of a unique maximal solution for stochastic Volterra
equation under local Lipschitz conditions. Lastly, in Section 3.4, we discuss the continuous dependence of solutions with respect to the coefficients.
In Section 4, using the weak convergence method, we prove the Freidlin–Wentzell large deviation principle for the small perturbations of stochastic Volterra equations under a compactness
assumption and some uniform non-explosion conditions for the controlled equations. We also
refer to [38,56] for the application of weak convergence approach in the LDPs of stochastic
evolution equations (the case of evolution triple). In the proof of Section 4, we need to use the
Yamada–Watanabe Theorem in infinite-dimensional space, which has been established by Ondreját [45] (see also [57] for the case of evolution triple). We want to say that although Ondreját
only considered the case of convolution semigroup, their proofs are also adapted to more general
stochastic Volterra equations. Moreover, since we are considering the path continuous solution,
the proof in [45] can be simplified.
In Section 5, a simple application in a class of semilinear stochastic evolutionary integral
equations is presented, which has been studied in [13,4,31], etc., for additive noises. Such type
of stochastic evolution equations appears in viscoelasticity, heat conduction in materials with
memory, and electrodynamics with memory [53].
In Section 6, we apply our general results to a large class of semilinear stochastic evolution
equations driven by multiplicative Brownian noises. A basic result in semigroup theory states
that if f is a Hölder continuous function in Banach space X, then
t
Tt−s f (s) ds is continuous in D(L),

t →
0

where Tt is an analytic semigroup and L is the generator of Tt . We will use this result to prove
the existence of strong solutions (in the sense of PDE) for semilinear SPDEs. The corresponding
LDPs are also obtained (see also [61,49,11,56,38], etc., for the study of LDPs of stochastic
evolution equations). More applications can be found in an uncompressed version [72].
In Section 7, we prove the existence and uniqueness of local Lp -strong solutions for stochastic Navier–Stokes equations (SNSE) in any dimensional case. In the two-dimensional case, we
also obtain the non-explosion of solutions. Moreover, the LDPs for two-dimensional SNSEs
are established in the case of both Dirichlet boundary and periodic boundary. We remark that
the Lp -solutions for SNSEs have been studied by Brzeźniak and Peszat [9] (bounded domain) and Mikulevicius and Rozovskii [40] (the whole space). The large deviation result for
two-dimensional SNSEs with additive noise was proved by Chang [12] using Girsanov’s transformation. In [60], the authors also used the weak convergence method to prove the large

1365

deviation estimate for two-dimensional SNSEs with multiplicative noises. But, they worked
in the L2 -space and only for weak solutions. Here we can do it for strong solutions in Lp space.
We conclude this introduction by making the following C ONVENTION: Throughout this paper,
the letter C with or without subscripts will denote a positive constant, whose value may change
from one place to another. Moreover, we also use the notation E1  E2 to denote E1  C · E2 ,
where C > 0 is an unimportant constant.

The function r defined by (2.3) is called the resolvent of κ. All the functions κ in Lemma 2.1
will be denoted by K . In what follows, we shall denote by K0 the subclass of K with the
property that

We also denote by K>1 the set of all nonnegative measurable functions κ on  with the property
that for any T > 0 and some β = β(T ) > 1,

Let 0  h ∈ L1loc (R+ ). If κ(t, s) = h(s), then κ ∈ K0 and

When 0  h ∈ L1 (R+ ), a classical result due to Paley and Wiener (cf. [42, p. 207, Theorem 5.2])

In this case, â(s) = ĥ(s)/(1 − ĥ(s)), where the hat denotes the Laplace transform, i.e.:

We want to say that (2.8) is useful in the study of large time asymptotic behavior of solutions for
Volterra equations. An important extension to nonintegrable convolution kernel can be found in
[59,29] (see also [27]). A simple example is provided in Example 3.2 below.
We now prove the following Gronwall’s lemma of Volterra type (see also [28, Lemma 7.1.1]
for a case of special convolution kernel).
Lemma 2.2. Let κ ∈ K and rn and r be defined respectively by (2.1) and (2.3). Let f, g : R+ →
R+ be two measurable functions satisfying that for any T > 0 and some n ∈ N,
t
t →

rn (t, s)f (s) ds ∈ L∞ (0, T )

Proof. First of all, if we define
t
h(t) := g(t) +

r(t, s)g(s) ds,
0

then by (2.4) and (2.10)
t
h(t) = g(t) +

κ(t, s)h(s) ds

for a.a. t ∈ (0, ∞).

Thus, by (2.11) we have

Set f˜(t) := f (t) − h(t) and define
f˜∗ (t) := ess sup f˜(s),

t > 0,

s∈[0,t]

and
τ0 := inf t > 0: f˜∗ (t) > 0 .
Clearly, t → f˜∗ (t) is non-decreasing and
f˜(t)  0 for a.a. t ∈ [0, τ0 ).

(2.14)

We want to prove that
τ0 = +∞.

If C0 = 1, there are at least two solutions x(t) ≡ 0 and x(t) = t; if C0 = π2 , there are infinitely

2.2. Itô’s integral in 2-smooth Banach spaces
Throughout this paper, we shall fix a stochastic basis (Ω, F , P ; (Ft )t0 ), i.e., a complete
probability space with a family of right-continuous filterations. In what follows, without special
declarations, all expectations E are taken with respect to the probability measure P .
Let {W k (t): t  0, k ∈ N} be a sequence of independent one-dimensional standard Brownian
motions on (Ω, F , P ; (Ft )t0 ). Let l 2 be the usual Hilbert space of all square summable real
number sequences, {ek , k ∈ N} the usual orthonormal basis of l 2 . Let X be a separable Banach
space, and L(l 2 ; X) the set of all bounded linear operators from l 2 to X. For an operator B ∈
L(l 2 ; X), we also write
B = (B1 , B2 , . . .) ∈ XN ,

Bk = Bek .

Definition 2.5. An operator B ∈ L(l 2 ; X) is called radonifying if
the series

Bek · W k (1) converges in L2 (Ω; X).

We shall denote by L2 (l 2 ; X) the space of all radonifying operators, and write for B ∈ L2 (l 2 ; X),

Proposition 2.6. The space L2 (l 2 ; X) with norm (2.16) is a separable Banach space.
In order to introduce the stochastic integral of an X-valued measurable (Ft )-adapted process

The following two typical examples of 2-smooth Banach spaces are usually met in applications.
Example 2.8. Let X be a separable Hilbert space. Clearly, X is 2-smooth. In this case, L2 (l 2 ; X)

Lp (E, μ; H) be the usual H-valued Lp -space over (E, E, μ). Then X = Lp (E, μ; H) is 2smooth (cf. [50,6]). In this case, by BDG’s inequality for Hilbert valued martingale we have

We also recall the following Kolmogorov’s continuity criterion, which can be derived directly
by Garsia’s inequality (cf. [64]).
Theorem 2.10. Let {X(t), t  0} be an X-valued stochastic process, and τ a bounded random
time. Suppose that for some C0 , p > 0 and δ > 1,

p

E X(t) − X(s) · 1{s,t∈[0,τ ]} X  C0 |t − s|δ .

2.3. A criterion for Laplace principles
It is well known that there exists a Hilbert space so that l 2 ⊂ U is Hilbert–Schmidt with
embedding operator J and {W k (t), k ∈ N} is a Brownian motion with values in U, whose covariance operator is given by Q = J ◦ J ∗ . For example, one can take U as the completion of l 2

For T > 0 and a Banach space B, we denote by B(B) the Borel σ -field, and by CT (B) the

(2.20)

It is well known that with respect to the weak convergence topology in 2T (cf. [32]),
DN is metrizable as a compact Polish space.

(2.21)

Let S be a Polish space. A function I : S → [0, ∞] is given.
Definition 2.11. The function I is called a rate function if for every a < ∞, the set {f ∈ S:
I (f )  a} is compact in S.
Let {Z : CT (U) → S,  ∈ (0, 1)} be a family of measurable mappings. Assume that there is
a measurable map Z0 : 2T → S such that:
(LD)1 For any N > 0, if a family {h ,  ∈ (0, 1)} ⊂ ATN (as random variables in DN ) converges
k
in distribution to h ∈ ATN , then for some subsequence k , Zk (· + h√(·)
) converges in
k
distribution to Z0 (h) in S.
(LD)2 For any N > 0, if {hn , n ∈ N} ⊂ DN weakly converges to h ∈ 2T , then for some subsequence hnk , Z0 (hnk ) converges to Z0 (h) in S.

(2.22)

where inf ∅ = ∞ by convention. Then under (LD)2 , I (f ) is a rate function. In fact, assume that

We recall the following result due to [5,10] (see also [67, Theorem 4.4]).
Theorem 2.12. Under (LD)1 and (LD)2 , {Z ,  ∈ (0, 1)} satisfies the Laplace principle with the
rate function I (f ) given by (2.22). More precisely, for each real bounded continuous function g

3. Abstract stochastic Volterra integral equations

and


 

B :  × Ω × X → L2 l 2 ; X ∈ M × B(X)/B L2 l 2 ; X .
Here and below,  := {(t, s) ∈ R2+ : s  t}, and M denotes the progressively measurable σ field on  × Ω generated by the sets E ∈ B() × F with properties: 1E (t, s, ·) ∈ Fs for all
(t, s) ∈ , and s → 1E (t, s, ω) is right continuous for any t ∈ R+ and ω ∈ Ω.
We start with the global existence and uniqueness of solutions for Eq. (3.1) under global
Lipschitz conditions and singular kernels.
3.1. Global existence and uniqueness

By Lemma 2.2 again, we have for almost all t ∈ [0, T ],

Hence, there exists an X-valued (Ft )-adapted process X(t) such that for almost all t ∈ [0, T ],

Taking limits for (3.6), one finds that (3.2) holds.
Moreover, estimate (3.3) follows from (3.9). Note that when (3.4) is satisfied, the constant
CT ,p in (3.7) is independent of T . Hence, estimate (3.5) is direct from (3.8). The uniqueness
follows by similar calculations as above. 2
Example 3.2. Let for δ > 0,
h(s) :=

It is easy to see that h ∈ L1 (R+ ). Consider the following stochastic Volterra equation:

So, (H1)–(H3) are satisfied with p = 2. Moreover, by (2.8) and (3.5), one finds that if δ is large

We first introduce the following notion of local solutions.
Definition 3.5. Let τ be an (Ft )-stopping time, and {X(t); t ∈ [0, τ )} an X-valued continuous
(Ft )-adapted process. The pair of (X, τ ) is called a local solution of Eq. (3.1) if P -a.s., for all
t ∈ [0, τ ),

X(t) = g(t) +

(X, τ ) is called a maximal solution of Eq. (3.1) if


lim X(t, ω)X = +∞

t↑τ (ω)

on ω: τ (ω) < +∞ , P -a.s.

We call (X, τ ) a non-explosion solution of Eq. (3.1) if
P ω: τ (ω) < +∞ = 0.
Remark 3.6. The stochastic integral in the above definition is defined on [0, τ ) by
t

where τn := inf{t > 0: X(t) X > n}  τ as n → ∞.
We now prove the following main result in this section.
Theorem 3.7. Under (H1) –(H4) , there exists a unique maximal solution (X, τ ) for Eq. (3.1) in
the sense of Definition 3.5.
Proof. For n ∈ N, let χn be a positive smooth function on R+ with χn (s) = 1, s  n, and
χn (s) = 0, s  n + 1. Define


An (t, s, ω, x) := A(t, s, ω, x) · χn x X ,


Bn (t, s, ω, x) := B(t, s, ω, x) · χn x X .
It is easy to see that for An and Bn , (H2) holds with κ1,n+1 , (H4) holds with λn+1 , and (H3)
holds with some κ3,n ∈ K0 . Thus, by Theorem 3.3 there exists a unique continuous (Ft )-adapted
process Xn (t) such that for any p  2 and T > 0,

We have the following claim:
Let τ be any stopping time. The uniqueness holds for (3.16) on [0, τ ).
We remark that when τ = T is non-random, it follows from Theorem 3.1. Let Xi (t), i = 1, 2, be
two X-valued continuous (Ft )-adapted processes and satisfy on [0, τ ),

Set
Z(t) := X1 (t) − X2 (t).
Since κ3,n ∈ K0 , as the calculations in (3.7), by BDG’s inequality (2.17) and (H3) for An and Bn ,
we have

By Lemma 2.2, we get

p
EZ(t) · 1{t<τ } X = 0 for almost all t ∈ [0, T ],
which implies by the arbitrariness of T and the continuities of Xi (t), i = 1, 2,
X1 (·)|[0,τ ) = X2 (·)|[0,τ ) .
The claim is proved.
Now, for n ∈ N, define the stopping times


τn := inf t > 0: Xn (t)X > n
and


σn := inf t > 0: Xn+1 (t)X > n .
By the above claim, we have
Xn (·)|[0,τn ∧σn ) = Xn+1 (·)|[0,τn ∧σn ) ,

(3.17)

X. Zhang / Journal of Functional Analysis 258 (2010) 1361–1425

1387

which implies
τn  σn  τn+1 ,

a.s.

Hence, we may define
τ (ω) := lim τn (ω)
n→∞

and for all t < τ (ω),
X(t, ω) := Xn (t, ω),

if t < τn (ω).

Clearly, (X, τ ) is a maximal solution of Eq. (3.1) in the sense of Definition 3.5.
We next prove the uniqueness. Let (X̃, τ̃ ) be another maximal solution of Eq. (3.1) in the
sense of Definition 3.5. Define the stopping times


τ̃n := inf t > 0: X̃(t)X > n
and
τ̂n := τn ∧ τ̃n ,

τ̂ := τ ∧ τ̃ .

It is clear that
τ̂n  τ̂

a.s. as n → ∞,

and
t
1[0,τ̂n ) (t) · X̃(t) = 1[0,τ̂n ) (t) · g(t) + 1[0,τ̂n ) (t) ·



A t, s, X̃(s) ds

0

t
+ 1[0,τ̂n ) (t) ·



B t, s, X̃(s) dW (s)

0

t
= 1[0,τ̂n ) (t) · g(t) + 1[0,τ̂n ) (t) ·



An t, s, X̃(s) ds

0

t
+ 1[0,τ̂n ) (t) ·



Bn t, s, X̃(s) dW (s).

0

By the above claim again, we have
X(·)|[0,τ̂n ) = X̃(·)|[0,τ̂n ) .

1388

X. Zhang / Journal of Functional Analysis 258 (2010) 1361–1425

So
X(·)|[0,τ̂ ) = X̃(·)|[0,τ̂ ) .
By the definition of maximal solution we must have τ̂ = τ = τ̃ .

2

We have the following simple criterion of non-explosion.
Theorem 3.8. Assume that (H1) , (H2) and (H4) hold, and κ1 in (H2) belongs to K>1 . Then
there is no explosion for Eq. (3.1).
Proof. Let (X, τ ) be a maximal solution of Eq. (3.1). Define


τn := inf t > 0: X(t)X  n .
By BDG’s inequality (2.17) and Hölder’s inequality, and using the same method as estimating
(3.17), we have, for any T > 0 and some β > 1 and p  2β ∗ (β ∗ = β/(β − 1)),

3.4. Continuous dependence of solutions with respect to data

Let {(gm , Am , Bm ), m ∈ N} be a sequence of coefficients associated to Eq. (3.1). Assume that

4. Large deviation for stochastic Volterra equations
In this section, we study the large deviation of small perturbations for stochastic Volterra
equations and work in the finite time interval [0, T ].
In what follows, we fix a densely defined closed linear operator L on X for which
Sφ := λ ∈ C: 0 < φ  |arg λ|  π ⊂ ρ(L),

(4.1)

and for some C  1,


(λ − L)−1 

L(X)



C
,
1 + |λ|

λ ∈ Sφ ,

where ρ(L) denotes the resolvent set of L. The above operator L is also called sectorial (cf. [28,
p. 18]). It is well known that L generates an analytic semigroup
Tt = e−Lt ,

t  0.

Moreover, we also assume that L−1 is a bounded linear operator on X, i.e.,
0 ∈ ρ(L).
Thus, for any α ∈ R, the fractional power Lα is well defined (cf. [28,48]). For α > 0, we define
the fractional Sobolev space Xα by
 
Xα := D Lα
with the norm


x Xα := Lα x X .

X. Zhang / Journal of Functional Analysis 258 (2010) 1361–1425

1393

For α < 0, Xα is defined as the completion of X with respect to the above norm. It is clear that
Xα is still 2-smooth, and B ∈ L2 (l 2 ; Xα ) if and only if Lα B ∈ L2 (l 2 ; X), i.e.,


B L2 (l 2 ;Xα ) = Lα B L (l 2 ;X) .

(4.2)

2

We recall the following well-known properties about Tt for later use (cf. [28, pp. 24–27] or
[48, p. 74]).
Proposition 4.1.
(i) Tt : X → Xα for each t > 0 and α > 0.
(ii) For each t > 0, α ∈ R and every x ∈ Xα , Tt Lα x = Lα Tt x.
(iii) For some δ > 0 and each t, α > 0, the operator Lα Tt is bounded in X and

 α
L Tt x   Cα t −α e−δt x X ,
X

∀x ∈ X.

(iv) Let α ∈ (0, 1] and x ∈ Xα , then
Tt x − x X  Cα t α x Xα .
(v) For any 0  β < α,

where  ∈ (0, 1). By Theorem 3.7, there exists a unique maximal solution (X , τ ) for Eq. (4.3).
Below, we fix T > 0 and work in the finite time interval [0, T ], and assume that for each  ∈
(0, 1),
τ > T ,

a.s.

By Yamada–Watanabe’s theorem (cf. [45,57]), there exists a measurable mapping
Φ : CT (U) → CT (X)
such that


X (t, ω) = Φ W (·, ω) (t).
It should be noticed that although the equation considered in [45] is a little different from
Eq. (3.1), the proof is still adapted to our more general equation.
We now fix a family of processes {h ,  ∈ (0, 1)} in ATN (see (2.20) for the definition of ATN ),
and put


h (·, ω)
(t).
X  (t, ω) := Φ W (·, ω) + √

Here, we have used a little confused notations X and X  , but they are clearly different. By
Girsanov’s theorem (cf. [45, Section 7]), X  (t) solves the following stochastic Volterra equation
(also called control equation):

Although h is defined only on [0, T ], we can extend it to R+ by setting ḣ(t) = 0 for t > T so
that Eq. (4.4) can be considered on R+ . We shall always use this extension below. Let τ  be the
explosion time of Eq. (4.4). For n ∈ N, define


τn := inf t  0: X  (t)X > n .
Then τn  τ  as n → ∞. We have:

In order to obtain the tightness of the laws of {X  ,  ∈ (0, 1)} in CT (X), we assume that:
(C1) L−1 is a compact operator on X.
(C2) limn→∞ sup∈(0,1) P {ω: τn (ω) < T } = 0.
Note that (C2) implies
P ω: τ  (ω) > T = 1.
We now prove the following key lemma for the large deviation principle of Eq. (4.3).
Lemma 4.4. Under (C1) and (C2), there exist subsequence k ↓ 0, a probability space (Ω̃, F̃ , P̃ )
and a sequence {(h̃k , X̃ k , W̃ k )}k∈N as well as (h, X h , W̃ ) defined on this probability space and
taking values in DN × CT (X) × CT (U) such that:
(i) (h̃k , X̃ k , W̃ k ) has the same law as (hk , X k , W ) for each k ∈ N;
(ii) (h̃k , X̃ k , W̃ k ) → (h, X h , W̃ ) in DN × CT (X) × CT (U), P̃ -a.s. as k → ∞;

(cf. [30]), the set KR is compact in CT (X). For any δ > 0, by (C2) we can choose n sufficiently

Thus, by the compactness of DN (see (2.21)), the laws of (h , X  , W ) in DN × CT (X) × CT (U)

The following property of analytic resolvent {St : t > 0} is crucial for the proof of Theorem 5.2 below (cf. [53, Corollary 2.1]).
Proposition 5.1. Let St be an analytic resolvent of type (ω0 , θ0 ). Then for any T > 0,

and for any t ∈ (0, T ],

where the dot denotes the operator derivative and · L(X;X) denotes the norm of bounded linear
operators.
By a solution of Eq. (5.1) we mean that X(t) satisfies the following stochastic Volterra equation:

Let us define
A(t, s, ω, x) := St−s Φ(s, ω, x),

B(t, s, ω, x) := St−s Ψ (s, ω, x).

We have:
Theorem 5.2. Under (S1) and (S2), there exists a unique maximal solution (X, τ ) for Eq. (5.5)
in the sense of Definition 3.5. Moreover, if (S3) holds, then τ = +∞, a.s.

Lastly, if (S3) is satisfied, it is clear that (H2) holds with κ1 (t, s) = (s∧1)
β ∈ K>1 , and (H4)
also holds from the above calculations. The non-explosion then follows from Theorem 3.8. 2
We now turn to the small perturbation of Eq. (5.5) and assume that Φ and Ψ are non-random.

In order to use Theorem 4.6 to get the LDP for {X ,  ∈ (0, 1)}, we also assume:

where r, t ∈ [0, T ] and T , δ > 0.
We have:
Theorem 5.3. Under (S1)–(S4) and (C1), for any x0 ∈ D(L), {X ,  ∈ (0, 1)} satisfies the large
deviation principle in CT (X) with the rate function I (f ) given by (4.8).
Proof. From the proof of Theorem 5.2, it is enough to check (H1) and (H2) . By (5.6) and [53,
p. 57, Theorem 2.2 (ii)], we have


LSt L(X;X)  Ceω1 t 1 + t −α1 ,

∀t > 0,

Thus, (H2) holds by choosing α < 1−β
α1 , where β is from (S3).

For (H1) , since x0 ∈ D(L) = X1 , by (5.3) we have
LSt x0 X = St Lx0 X  C Lx0 X .
On the other hand, by the resolvent equation (5.2) and (5.7) we have, for any 0  t < t   T ,

Moreover, for the kernel function aα , if

π

where φ comes from (4.1), then St is analytic (cf. [53, p. 55, Example 2.1]). Notice that in [53],
−L is considered. In this case, (5.6) and (5.7) clearly hold since âα (λ) = λ−α , Re λ > 0.
6. Semilinear stochastic partial differential equations
When a = 1 in Eq. (5.1), one sees that Eq. (5.1) contains a class of semilinear SPDEs. However, it cannot deal with the equation like stochastic Navier–Stokes equation. In this section, we
shall discuss strong solutions of a large class of semilinear SPDEs by using the properties of
analytic semigroups.
Consider the following semilinear stochastic partial differential equation:




dX(t) = −LX(t) + Φ t, X(t) dt + Ψ t, X(t) dW (t),

X(0) = x0 .

We introduce the following assumptions on the coefficients:
(M1) For some α ∈ (0, 1),
Φ : R+ × Ω × Xα → X ∈ M × B(Xα )/B(X)
and

(ii) limt↑τ X(t) Xα = +∞ on {ω: τ (ω) < +∞};

Hence, by Theorem 3.7 there is a unique maximal solution (Y, τ ) for Eq. (6.3) in the sense of
Definition 3.5. Set
X(t) = L−α Y (t).
It is easy to see that (X, τ ) is a unique maximal solution for Eq. (6.2), which satisfies (i), (ii)
and (iii) in the theorem.
Lastly, if (M3) is satisfied, then as estimating (6.4), for the above A and B, (H2) holds with
some κ1 ∈ K>1 , and also (H4) holds. So, by Theorem 3.8 we have τ = ∞ a.s. 2
Remark 6.2. The solution (X, τ ) in Theorem 6.1 is clearly a local solution of Eq. (6.2) in X.
However, it may be not a maximal solution in X because it may happen that

Next, we study the large deviation estimate for Eq. (6.1), and assume that Φ and Ψ are nonrandom. Consider the following small perturbation of Eq. (6.1):

In order to apply Theorem 4.6 to this situation, we need the non-explosion assumptions as (C2)
and (C3). For a family of processes {h ,  ∈ (0, 1)} in ATN (see (2.20) for the definition of ATN ),

Our large deviation principle can be stated as follows:
Theorem 6.3. Assume (M1) and (M2). Let x0 ∈ Xδ for some 1  δ > α, where α is from (M1).

Then {X ,  ∈ (0, 1)} satisfies the large deviation principle in CT (Xα ) with the rate function
I (f ) given by
I (f ) :=

f ∈ CT (Xα ).

(6.8)

Proof. By Theorem 4.6, it only needs to check (H1) and (H2) for Eq. (6.3). Since x0 ∈ Xδ
with δ > α, by (iv) of Proposition 4.1, (H1) holds with δ  = δ − α and α  ∈ (0, δ − α). As the
calculations given in (6.4), one finds that (H2) holds with α  ∈ (0, 1 − α − β). 2
Remark 6.4. If (M3) is satisfied, one can see that (6.6) and (6.7) hold by Remark 4.7.
Below we study the existence of strong solutions for Eq. (6.1). For this aim, in addition to
(M1) and (M2) with β = 0, we also assume:

Hence, by Lemmas 7.4 and 7.5 we have
