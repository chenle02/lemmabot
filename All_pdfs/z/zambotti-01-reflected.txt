We prove that a stochastic heat equation with reflection at 0, on the spatial
interval [0, 1] with Dirichlet boundary conditions and additive white-noise, admits
an explicit symmetrizing invariant measure on C([0, 1]): the 3-d Bessel Bridge, i.e.,
the law of the modulus of a 3-dimensional Brownian motion conditioned to be 0
at time 1, a classical measure in probability theory, also connected with the theory
of excursions of Brownian motion. This is a non-trivial example of a Gibbs-type
measure being singular with respect to the reference Gaussian measure and concen 2001

1. INTRODUCTION
In [6], Nualart and Pardoux studied existence and uniqueness of a solution to a reflected stochastic heat equation, namely of a pair (u, '), where
u is a continuous function of (t, !) # O :=[0, +)_[0, 1] and ' is a
positive measure on O, satisfying

{

where x : [0, 1] [ [0, ) is continuous with x(0)=x(1)=0, [W(t, !) :

The aim of this paper is to prove that Eq. (1) admits, on the space
C 0(0, 1) of continuous functions of ! # [0, 1], satisfying Dirichlet boundary
conditions, an explicit invariant and symmetrizing measure, given by

where & is a well-known probability measure on C 0(0, 1): the 3-d Bessel
bridge, namely the law of the modulus of a 3-dimensional Brownian
motion (B { ) { # [0, 1] , conditioned to be 0 at {=1. This measure plays an
important role in the study of Brownian motion (see [7]).
On the other hand, Da Prato proved in [2] the existence of a symmetric
semigroup (P t ) t0 on L 2(H, ( H e &2U d+) &1 e &2U d+), associated with the
stochastic differential inclusion
dX # (AX&U(X )) dt+dW,

X(0)=x # H,

(3)

where H is a separable Hilbert space, A :=D(A)/H [ H is a strictly
negative self-adjoint operator such that Q :=(&2A) &1 is trace-class, + is
the Gaussian measure N(0, Q) on H with 0 mean and covariance operator
Q, and W is a cylindrical white-noise on H. Moreover, U: H [ R _ [+]
is a convex, lower semicontinuous function, satisfying suitable integrability
conditions with respect to + and
+(x : U(x)<+ and U(x){<)=1,
where U(x), the subdifferential of U at x, is defined as the subset of H:
U(x) :=[ y # H : U(x+h)U(x)+( h, y), \h # H ].
Equation (1) can be interpreted as an example of (3), setting H :=
L 2(0, 1), A :=(12) d 2d! 2 on H with Dirichlet boundary conditions,

Then (1) can be written formally as a differential inclusion of measures:

 2W
u
&Au&
d! # U (u(t, } )).
t
t !

However, in this case +(U=+)=1 (see Lemma 5 below) and the
measure ``( H e &2U d+) &1 e &2U d+'' is not well defined. Our result shows
that a natural Gibbs-type measure for (1) is provided by (2). Notice that
& is not Gaussian and is even singular with respect to the reference
Gaussian measure +. Moreover, the support of & is a closed convex set having empty interior both in the topologies of L 2(0, 1) and C([0, 1]).
The proof we give relies on the construction of solutions to (1) given by
Nualart and Pardoux in [6] and on a result of Biane on a connection
between the law of the Brownian Bridge and the law of the 3-d Bessel
Bridge (see [1] and Theorem 4 below).

We set K : :=[h # H : h &:] with :0, and we denote by 6 K: : H [ K :
the projection from H onto the closed convex set K : /H. Recall that 6 K:
is 1-Lipschitz continuous. If DH, we denote by C b(D) the space of all
.: D [ R being bounded and uniformly continuous with respect to & } &. If
DH and . # C b(D), we denote by | . the modulus of continuity of .:
| . : [0, ) [ [0, 1],

| .(r) :=sup[ |.(x)&.(x$)| 7 1 : &x&x$&r].

We identify C b(K : ) with a subspace of C b(H ) by means of the injection:
C b(K : ) % . [ . b 6 K: # C b(H ). If 0:;, then C b(K : )C b(K ; ).
If [m n ] n _ [m] is a sequence of probability measures on (H, B(H )),
where B(H ) is the Borel _-field of H, we say that m n converges weakly to

Given a Markov process [Y(t, x) : t0, x # D] on DH, we say that a

We denote by 1 D ( } ) the characteristic function of a set D. We sometimes
write m(.) for  H . dm, . # C b(H ).
By W=[W(t, !) : (t, !) # O] we denote a two-parameter Wiener process
defined on a complete probability space (0, F, P), i.e., W is a Gaussian
process with zero mean and covariance function
E [W(t, !) W(t$, !$)]=(t 7 t$)(! 7 !$),

(t, !), (t$, !$) # O.

We denote by Ft the _-field generated by the random variables [W(s, !) :

(s, !) # [0, t]_[0, 1]] and by C 
c (0, 1) the subset of C 0(0, 1) of all C
functions with support being compact in (0, 1).
We always assume in the following that:
(H1)

f =f 1 + f 2 , f 1 , f 2 : [0, 1]_R [ R are jointly measurable.

(H2) There exists c>0 such that | f 1(!, y)& f 1(!, y$)| c | y& y$| for

Following [6], we set the following:
Definition 1. A pair (u, ') is said to be a solution of Eq. (5) with
reflection in &:0 and initial value x # K : & C 0(0, 1), if:
(i) [u(t, !) : (t, !) # O] is a continuous and adapted process, i.e.,

(ii) '(dt, d!) is a random positive measure on O such that
'([0, T]_[$, 1&$])<+ for all T, $>0, and ' is adapted; i.e., '(B) is
Ft -measurable for every Borel set B/[0, t]_[0, 1].

Finally, we will use the following:
Lemma 1. Let T be a Polish metric space, and let [m n ] n _ [m], respectively
[. n ] n , be a sequence of probability measures, resp. of real-valued continuous
functions, on T, satisfying:
v m n converges weakly to m.
v The family [. n ] n is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous on T.

3. THE PROCESS X : , :0
In [6], the following theorem is proved:
Theorem 1. Assume that f satisfies (H1), (H2), (H3), (H4) and let
x # K : & C 0(0, 1). Then there exists a unique solution (u, ') to Eq. (5) with
reflection in &: and initial value x.
We recall the strategy of the proof, given in [6], of the existence of
solutions. First, the following approximating problem is introduced:

{

 2W (:+u =: ) &
u =: 1  2u =:

with =>0, (r) & :=sup[ &r, 0], and :0. This is now a SPDE in L 2(0, 1)
with additive noise and monotone or Lipschitz-continuous drift terms, for
which existence and uniqueness of a solution are well known (see [3]).
Then, if x # K : & C 0(0, 1), the following is proved:
(a)

u =:(t, } ) # C 0(0, 1) for all t0, and u =: is continuous on O.

(b) The map 0<= [ u =:(t, !) is non-decreasing for all (t, !) # O. The
limit lim = a 0 u =:(t, !)=sup =>0 u =:(t, !)=: u :(t, !) is finite for all (t, !) # O,
u :(t, } ) # K : & C 0(0, 1) for all t0, and u : is continuous on O.
(c) The measure on O, ' =:(dt, d!) :=(1=)(:+u =: ) & dt d!, converges
distributionally to a measure ' :(dt, d!) on O.
(d) The pair (u : , ' : ) is the solution to (5) with reflection in &: and
initial value x # K : & C 0(0, 1).
We set for all t0, :0, =>0:
v X :(t, x) # C 0(0, 1), X :(t, x)(!) :=u :(t, !), x # K : & C 0(0, 1),
v X =:(t, x) # H, X =:(t, x)(!) :=u =:(t, !), x # H.
Lemma 2. For all :0, =>0, t0, we have: \x, x$ # C 0(0, 1),
&X =:(t, x)&X =:(t, x$)&e ct &x&x$&,

(7)

where & } & denotes the norm in H and c>0 is the constant of (H2).
Proof.

By the monotonicity properties of ( } ) & and f 2(!, } ) we have
1d
&X =:(t, x)&X =:(t, x$)& 2 c &X =:(t, x)&X =:(t, x$)& 2
2 dt

and the thesis follows from Gronwall's lemma. K
Therefore, the same estimate holds for X : , :0 : \x, x$ # K : & C 0(0, 1),
&X :(t, x)&X :(t, x$)&e ct &x&x$&

(8)

and we can uniquely extend X =:(t, } ), respectively X :(t, } ), to maps from H
to H, resp. from K : to K : , that we denote by the same symbols, satisfying
(7) for all x, x$ # H, resp. (8) for all x, x$ # K : . We set for all :0, =>0,

In particular, (P :(t)) t0 is a Markov semigroup acting on C b(K : ).
Proof.

For (12), notice that, by (8), for all x, x$ # K : :
|P :(t) .(x)&P :(t) .(x$)| E[ |.(X :(t, x))&.(X :(t, x$))| ]
E[| .(&X :(t, x)&X :(t, x$)&)]
| .(e ct &x&x$&),

and (11) follows analogously. Equation (13) is a consequence of (b) in the
proof of Theorem 1 and (11). It is well known that (P =:(t)) t0 is a semigroup acting on C b(H ): since the family of probability measures [m = ] =>0 ,
where m = is the law of X =:(s, x), and the family of functions [P =:(t) .] =>0
satisfy the Hypothesis of Lemma 1; Eq. (14) follows. K
Lemma 4. For all . # C b(H ), lim : a 0 P :(t) .(x)=P 0(t) .(x), t0, x # K 0 .
Proof. If x # K 0 & C 0(0, 1), then the map 0<: [ X =:(t, x)(!) is nondecreasing for all (t, !) # O, =>0. Therefore,
lim X :(t, x)(!)=sup X :(t, x)(!)=sup sup X =:(t, x)(!)

=>0 :>0

=>0

=X 0(t, x)(!),
since sup :>0 X =:(t, x)( } )=X =0(t, x)( } ) by the uniqueness of solutions to (6).
The general case follows by (12) and a density argument. K

admitting as symmetrizing measure + :=N(0, (&2A) &1 ), i.e., the Gaussian
measure on H with 0 mean and covariance operator (&2A) &1.
Our next lemma identifies + with a well-known probability measure on
C 0(0, 1): the law of the Brownian bridge. Recall that the Brownian bridge
is defined as a linear Brownian motion (w { ) { # [0, 1] , conditioned to be 0 at
{=1, and can be realized as [0, 1] % { [ w { &{w 1 . The law of the
Brownian bridge is concentrated on C 0(0, 1) and is the unique Gaussian
measure on R [0, 1] with 0 mean and covariance function: 1({, _)=
{ 7 _&{_, _, { # [0, 1], (see [7, Chap. I]).
Lemma 5. The measure + coincides with the law of the Brownian bridge.
Proof. Recall that the measure + is concentrated on C([0, 1])/H. By
definition of Gaussian measures, the following holds for all h, k # H:

| ( x, h)( x, k) N(0, (&2A) )(dx)=( (&2A)

Since the operator (&2A) &1 can be expressed as an integral operator with
kernel: ! 7 _&!_, !, _ # [0, 1], then setting in (19) h=/ [0, t] , k=/ [0, s] ,

; { :=e { Ä ` &e ` ,

(; { ) { # [0, 1] ,

where Ä denotes the sum mod 1, is a Brownian bridge.
Theorem 3 was proved in [8]. We give here a proof, based on Theorem 4,
which seems to be promising for further developments.
We set e { : C 0(0, 1) [ R, e {(x) :=x({), { # [0, 1]. Then (e { ) { # [0, 1] is a
3-d Bessel bridge under &. By Theorem 4 and (16), we have for :>0,

Lemma 6. For all r # [0, 1], there exists a regular conditional distribution

For all . # C b(H ), we set

where S 2 is the unitary sphere in R 3 and _(dn) is the normalized uniform
distribution on S 2. Then (23), respectively (24), is a regular conditional
distribution of & given e r , resp. of P(b # } ) given b(1). In particular, the law
of | ;(0)| is equal to &. By (22) and (23) we have:
&(.(e ( } Ä r) &e r ) | e r = y)=E[.(?^ r(b, b )& y) | b r = y=b 1&r ].

Identifying h # L 2(0, 1) with h1 [0, 1] # L 2(0, ), we set . r : H_H [ R,
. r(h, k) :=.(?^ r(- r h( } r), - 1&r k( } (1&r)))&- r(1&r) y).
Since for #>0, - # B ( } #) is still a 3-d Brownian motion, we obtain by (25):
$ .(r, - r(1&r) y)
=&(.(e ( } Ä r) &e r ) | e r =- r(1&r) y)
=E[.(?^ r(b, b )&- r(1&r) y) | b r =- r(1&r) y=b 1&r ]

analogous computations hold for the integral on [12, 1], we obtain that

is well defined, that & F: , defined in (20), converges weakly to & F as : a 0, and
that X 0 is symmetric with respect to & F. The difficulty is that exp( &2F ) is
not bounded, so that we cannot apply directly Theorem 3.
Lemma 7. &(e &2F ) # ]0, [ and & F: converges weakly to & F as : a 0.
Proof. We retain the notations of the proof of Lemma 6. Moreover,
we set for all . # C b(H ), . F :=.e &2F. By Lemma 5 the law of ;(0) on
H_H_H is +  +  +=N(0, Q), Q :=(&2A) &1 Ä (&2A) &1 Ä (&2A) &1.
Since &2A? 2 >*, we have by (17), (H4) and by +(L N+1(0, 1))=1:

Theorem 5. & F is a symmetrizing measure for the processes [X 0(t, x) :

Proof. Arguing as in the proof of Theorem 2, the thesis follows from

&(K 0 & C 0(0, 1))=1. K
