Abstract
We consider the fully parabolic Keller–Segel system with singular sensitivity and logistic-type
source: ut = u − χ ∇ · ( uv ∇v) + ru − μuk , vt = v − v + u under the non-flux boundary conditions in a smooth bounded convex domain  ⊂ Rn , χ , r, μ > 0, k > 1. A global very weak so2

lution for the system with n ≥ 2 is obtained under one of the following conditions: (i) r > χ4 for
χ2

4(k−1)
0 < χ ≤ 2, or r > max{ 4 (1 − p02 ), χ − 1} for χ > 2 with p0 =

if k > 2. Furthermore, this global very weak solution should be

, k(k−1)(k−2)
k

globally bounded in fact provided μr and the initial data u0 L2 () , ∇vL4 () suitably small for n = 2, 3.
In addition, if k > 3(n+2)
n+4 replaces k > 2 in the condition (ii), the system admits globally bounded classical
solutions. All these describe the influence of the exponent k > 1 in the logistic-type source ru − μuk to the
behavior of solutions for the considered fully parabolic Keller–Segel system with singular sensitivity.

1. Introduction
Chemotaxis, a spontaneous aggregative phenomenon, is a widespread cross-diffusion mechanism in a wide rage of biological processes. In 1970, Keller and Segel proposed a model to
represent the chemotaxis phenomena, i.e., the oriented or partially oriented movement of cells in
response to a chemical signal produced by the cells themselves [9]:


ut = u − χ∇ · ( uv ∇v),

x ∈ , t > 0,

vt = v − v + u,

x ∈ , t > 0,

(1.1)

where the singular chemotactic sensitive function χv with χ > 0 is derived by the Weber–Fechner
laws on the response of the cells u to the chemical signal v. In the parabolic–elliptic case of (1.1),
where the second parabolic equation in (1.1) is replaced by the elliptic equation 0 = v − v + u.
It is known that all radial classical solutions are global-in-time if either n = 2 with χ > 0, or
2
n ≥ 3 with χ < n−2
[14]. When χ < n2 with n ≥ 1, there exists a unique globally bounded
n
classical solution [7]. If n ≥ 2 and χ < n−2
, there exists a generalized solution [3]. For the
parabolic–parabolic case, all solutions are global in time when either n = 1 [16], or n = 2 and
χ < 52 under the radial assumption, while χ < 1 without the radial assumption [15]. For n ≥ 2,

there exist globally bounded classical solutions if 0 < χ < n2 [5], and a global weak solution

n+2
if 0 < χ < 3n+4
[24]. Moreover, the system (1.6) possesses a global generalized solution for
n ≥ 2 [12], provided

(1.2)

See [11,6] for more results with singular sensitivities.
Generally, in a real chemotaxis system the proliferation-death mechanism of the cells u should
be included as well. This can be mathematically formulated by adding a logistic-type source
ru − μuk to the u-equation [2,10]


ut = u − χ∇ · (u∇v) + ru − μuk ,

x ∈ , t > 0,

τ vt = v − v + u,

x ∈ , t > 0,

(1.3)

where χ, r, μ > 0, k > 1 and τ ∈ {0, 1}. Such self-limiting growth source generally benefits
the global existence-boundedness of solutions. For parabolic–elliptic case (τ = 0 in (1.3)), it is
known with k = 2 that the solution is globally bounded if μ > n−2
n χ , global weak solution is
admitted for all μ > 0, and the constant equilibrium (1, 1) with r = μ is globally asymptotically
stable in L∞ () if μ > 2χ [18]. When k > 2 − n1 with n ≥ 1, there exists a global very weak
solution, which is globally bounded if μ sufficiently large and u0 L∞ () sufficiently small [21].
1
For the case with 0 = v − m(t) + u, m(t) := ||
 u(x, t)dx instead of 0 = v − v + u
in (1.3), there exists radial initial data such that the smooth solution blows up in finite time if
1
1 < k < 32 + 2n−2
with n ≥ 5 [25]. For the parabolic–parabolic case (τ = 1 in (1.3)), if k = 2,
n = 2 [17], or n ≥ 3 with μ > 0 sufficiently large [22], the solutions are globally bounded.

When k > 2 − n1 with n ≥ 1, the problem possesses global very weak solutions [19], which are
globally bounded if μr sufficiently small and the initial data sufficiently small in suitable norms
for n = 3 [20]. Refer to [4,27,28] for results with nonlinear diffusion and sensitivities.
Consider the chemotaxis system with singular sensitivity and logistic source

where χ, r, μ > 0 and τ ∈ {0, 1}. For the parabolic–elliptic case (τ = 0 in (1.4)) with n = 2, there

For the parabolic–parabolic case (τ = 1 in (1.4)), there exists a global solution when n = 2 [1].
Currently, the authors have proved that the condition (1.5) ensures the global boundedness of
classical solutions in fact as well [29].
In this paper, we continuously consider case with general exponent k > 1 in the logistic-type

To treat the more general exponent k > 1, we have to deal with very weak solutions. Inspired
by [21,19], we introduce the very weak solutions to (1.6) via the following definitions.
Definition 1.1. Let T > 0. A pair (u, v) of nonnegative functions

and the equality (1.9) hold for all ϕ and ψ satisfying (1.10) and (1.11).
Definition 1.3. Let T > 0. We call a couple (u, v) a very weak solution to (1.6) in  × (0, T ) if
it is both a very weak subsolution and a weak γ -entropy supersolution of (1.6) in  × (0, T ) for
some γ ∈ (0, 1). A global very weak solution to (1.6) is a pair of functions defined in  × (0, ∞)
which is a very weak solution to (1.6) in  × (0, T ) for all T > 0.

In order to study the dynamic behavior of solutions to the system (1.6), we will at first establish
a positive uniform-in-time lower bound of the chemical signal v. Similarly to those proceeded
in [29], this can be transformed to build the global boundedness for  u−α dx with α > 0 via a
crucial weighted integral  u−p v −q dx with p, q > 0 to be determined.
To deal with the global very weak solution of (1.3) in [19] (i.e., without singular sensitivity v1 in (1.6)), the main step is to conclude that the solution {v } ∈(0,1) of the regularization
k

k−1
((0, ∞); W 1, k−1 ()) with respect to the strong topology
problem is relatively compact in Lloc
1
for k ∈ (2 − n , 2). Differently, for the system (1.6), we will firstly show that {v } ∈(0,1) has a
uniform-in-time lower bound (independent of ∈ (0, 1)), namely,

1
∈(0,1)

v

is relatively compact in L∞
loc ( × (0, ∞))
with respect to the weak-star topology.

Secondly, it will be derived that for some p > k−1
with k > 2 − n1 that

 ∇v 

p

∈(0,1)

v

is relatively compact in Lloc ( × (0, ∞))
with respect to the weak topology.

Thirdly, it will be essential that
 ∇v 
∈(0,1)

v

is relatively compact in L2loc ( × (0, ∞))
with respect to the strong topology.

Upon selecting a suitable subsequence, we will obtain a global very weak solution for k >
2 − n1 with n ≥ 2 by a standard compactness argument. Furthermore, it will be shown that for the
carrying capacity μr and the initial data u0 L2 () + ∇v0 L4 () suitably small, this global very
weak solution for n = 2, 3 is in fact globally bounded.
Finally, for the case n ≥ 2 and k > 2, by estimating on  up dx +  |∇v|2q dx with the a

), we will conclude the global boundedness
priori estimate  |∇v|l dx < C for l ∈ (k, (n+2−k)
+
to classical solutions if k > 3(n+2)
n+4 and χ > 0 suitably small.
Now, we state the main results of this paper.

Theorem 1. Let n ≥ 2. There exists a global very weak solution to the system (1.6), if one of the
following holds:

Theorem 2. Let (u, v) be the global very weak solution established in Theorem 1 for n = 2, 3.
There exist η, λ > 0 small such that this very weak solution is globally bounded provided μr < η
and u0 2L2 () + ∇v0 4L4 () < λ.
Remark 1. It can be found that the global very weak solution to the system (1.6) with singular
sensitivity obtained in Theorem 1 (i) corresponds to that for the classical chemotaxis system (1.3)
in [21,19]. Theorem 2 says that the smallness of μr and the initial data (u0 , v0 ) ensure the global
boundedness of the very weak solution to the system (1.6), and the same were observed for the
classical chemotaxis system (1.3) in [21,20]. In particular, Theorems 1 and 2 show that k < 2 is
permitted for the global boundedness of solutions to (1.6). This extends the global boundedness
results for (1.6) (with k = 2) obtained in [29].
Theorem 3. Let n ≥ 2, k > 3(n+2)
n+4 and r, χ > 0 satisfy (1.14). Then the problem (1.6) possesses
a globally bounded classical solution.
Remark 2. Recall from [4,28] that the classical chemotaxis system (1.4) with logistic-type
source ru − μuk possesses globally bounded classical solutions if k > 2 or k = 2 with μ > 0
sufficiently large. While Theorem 3 says that the global boundedness of classical solutions requires k > 3(n+2)
n+4 for n ≥ 2 with the chemotactic coefficient χ > 0 suitably small to the present
problem (1.6). Here the difficulty due to the singular sensitivity involved in (1.6) is substantial.
Remark 3. By [29, Theorem 1] it was known for n = 2 that k = 2 ensures the global boundedness
of classical solutions to (1.6). On the other hand, it is easy to see that the value 3(n+2)
n+4 = 2 in
Theorem 3 if n = 2. Thus, combining with [29, Theorem 1], we conclude for the case n = 2 that
the classical solutions must be globally bounded if k ≥ 2.
The rest part of the paper is arranged as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the local existence
of classical solutions and establish a uniform-in-time lower bound estimate on v. Section 3 deals
with the global existence of classical solutions to the regularization problem of (1.6). Then we
prove the global existence and boundedness to the very weak solutions in Sections 4–6. Finally,
we study the global boundedness of classical solutions in Section 7.
2. Lower estimate of v for k > 1
We introduce a lemma on the local existence of classical solutions to the system (1.6)
without proof, which can be obtained by the standard contraction argument as that in [29,
Lemma 2.1].
Lemma 2.1. With k > 1 and q > n, there exist Tmax ∈ (0, +∞] and a unique pair (u, v) of
functions

Let (u, v) be the local classical solution established in this section. We give some simple a

2

To study the dynamic behavior of solutions to (1.6) for k > 1, the key step is to establish a positive uniform-in-time lower bound for v. This will be realized by a uniform-in-time
upper estimate for the weighted integral  u−p v −q dx with some p, q > 0. Repeating the procedure in the proof of [29, Lemma 3.2], we can get the following differential inequality on

In [29, Lemma 3.3] the authors proved that the chemical signal v for (1.4) (i.e. k = 2 in (1.6))
has the uniform-in-time lower bound if the growth rate r > 0 is suitably large with respect to
the chemotaxis coefficient χ > 0, or, in other words, χ > 0 is suitably small with respect to
r > 0. This mechanism is also valid for the general k > 1, even with more complicated representations.
At first consider the case k ∈ (1, 2].
Lemma 2.4. Under the condition of Theorem 1 (i), there exists δ1 > 0 such that
v(x, t) ≥ δ1 f or all t ∈ (0, Tmax ) and x ∈ .

(2.6)

Proof. The case of k = 2 was treated in [29, Lemma 3.3] already.
Assume k ∈ (1, 2). Let β0 := 12 infx∈ v0 (x). By Lemma 2.1, there exists t0 ∈ (0, Tmax ), such
that v(x, t) ≥ β0 for all x ∈  and t ∈ (0, t0 ], and u(x, t0 ) ≥ γ0 for all x ∈  with some γ0 > 0.
So we only need to prove (2.6) for t ∈ (t0 , Tmax ).
By Young’s inequality, we have

u−p+1 v −q−1 dx + (

u1−p+(k−2)(q+1) dx

(2.7)



for t ∈ (t0 , Tmax ). Notice that p, q > 0 with k ∈ (1, 2) implies 1 − p + (k − 2)(q + 1) < 1. Let
f (p) := 1 − p + (k − 2)(q+ + 1)


1
= −p + k − 1 + (k − 2)(p + 1)( 1 + pχ 2 − 1), p ∈ (0, k − 1).
2
√
4(k−1)
With the fact of 1 + s < 1 + 2s for s > 0, we know for p ∈ (0, 4+(2−k)kχ
2 ) ⊂ (0, k − 1) that
1
1
f (p) > −p + k − 1 + (k − 2)(p + 1)pχ 2 > −p + k − 1 + p(k − 2)kχ 2 > 0,
4
4
and hence there exists some q > q+ such that 1 −p +(k −2)(q +1) > 0. By the Hölder inequality
with (2.1), (2.5) and (2.7), we have
d
dt

u−p v −q dx ≤ (q − rp)


u−p v −q dx + C1 μq+1 , t ∈ (t0 , Tmax )


for some C1 > 0.
Next, denote
A(p) := q+ − rp =


p+1
( 1 + pχ 2 − 1) − rp, p > 0.
2

It is easy to see that A(p) < 0 is equivalent to
B(p) := χ 2 p 2 + 2(χ 2 − 2r − 2r 2 )p + χ 2 − 4r < 0, p > 0.

Next consider the case of k > 2.
Lemma 2.5. Under the condition of Theorem 1 (ii), there exists δ2 > 0 such that
v(x, t) ≥ δ2 f or all t ∈ (0, T ) and x ∈ .

(2.13)

Proof. Notice that k > 2 with p ∈ (0, k − 1) and q > 0 implies 1 − p + (k − 2)(q + 1) > 0.
Let
g(p) := −p + (k − 2)(q+ + 1)


1
= −p + k − 2 + (k − 2)(p + 1)( 1 + pχ 2 − 1), p ∈ (0, k − 1).

Since χ 2 < k(k−1)(k−2)
, we have

g(p) < −p + k − 2 + pχ 2 (p + 1)(k − 2) < −p + k − 2 + pχ 2 k(k − 2) < 0

4(k−2)
for p ∈ ( 4−(k−2)kχ
2 , k − 1), and hence there exists q > q+ such that 1 − p + (k − 2)(q + 1) ∈
(0, 1). Thus, we obtain from (2.7) and (2.1) that

by Young’s inequality with C4 > 0. It is easy to know that p1 < 1 by (2.9) for 0 < χ < r + 1.
4(k−2)
4(k−2)
Therefore, p2 > 4−(k−2)kχ
2 is sufficient to ensure ( 4−(k−2)kχ 2 , k − 1) ∩ (p1 , p2 ) = ∅. A simple
calculation shows

Similarly to (2.10)–(2.12) with (2.14), we conclude (2.13) with some δ2 > 0. 2

Lemma 3.1. Let  ⊂ Rn (n ≥ 2) be a bounded domain, k > 1 and q > n. If (u0 , v0 ) satisfies (1.7), then for each ∈ (0, 1) there exist Tmax, ≤ ∞ and a unique pair function

4. Estimates for (u , v )
To arrive at the global existence of very weak solutions to (1.6), we should also establish a
positive uniform-in-time lower bound of v for all ∈ (0, 1).
At first consider the case of k ∈ (1, 2].
Lemma 4.1. Under the condition of Theorem 1 (i), we have
v (x, t) ≥ δ1 for all ∈ (0, 1), x ∈  and t > 0
with δ1 defined in Lemma 2.4.

Lemma 4.2. Under the condition of Theorem 1 (ii), we have

as = j  0. This together with (6.7) yields that (u, v) is in fact a γ -entropy supersolution
of (1.6) as well.
(ii) For the case of k > 2 with r, χ > 0 satisfying (1.14), we can find that the conclusions
(4.9) and (4.17) for some γ ∈ (0, 12 ) are also valid by repeating the arguments for proving Lemmas 4.4 and 4.5, where Lemmas 4.2 and 4.3 are useful. This implies the corresponding results
(4.23)–(4.28). Therefore, we can conclude that (u, v) is also a very weak solution of (1.6) by
using the same procedures as those for the case (i).
The proof is complete. 2
Next, we will prove that the global very weak solution to (1.6) is globally bounded for
n = 2, 3. At first, we establish the following uniform-in-time estimate on  u2 dx for all
∈ (0, 1), with the initial data and μr suitably small.
Lemma 6.1. Let (u , v ) be the global very weak solution of the problem (1.6) established in
Theorem 1 with n = 2, 3. There exist η, λ > 0 such that
u2 dx ≤ M9 , t > 0,

(6.16)

provided μr < η and

(6.22)

Then there exists m∗0 > 0 such that h(s, m∗0 ) has the unique positive root s0 . Obviously, F (t) ≡ s0

h(s, m∗ ) < 0 whenever s ∈ (s1 , s0 ). By (6.21) with F (0) ≤ s0 , this concludes that

The case n = 2 can be treated similarly, and even more simply. We omit the details.

Proof of Theorem 2. Based on Lemma 6.1, we obtain the global boundedness of solutions to
the regularization problem by a similar argument as that in [29] that
u L∞ () + v L∞ () ≤ C, t > 0

(6.24)

with some C > 0 for all ∈ (0, 1). Consequently, we conclude that the very weak solution (u, v)
is globally bounded in time as well by taking = j  0. 2

7. Global boundedness to classical solutions
In this section we deal with classical solutions to (1.6) with k > 2 ensured by Lemma 2.1, and
begin with the known estimate below.
Lemma 7.1. ([27, Lemma 2.3]) Let n ≥ 1, k > 2, and (u, v) be the local classical solution
nk
of (1.6). Then there exists M10 > 0 such that for k < m < (n+2−k)
+
∇vLm () ≤ M10 , t ∈ (0, Tmax ).

(7.1)

Due to the singularity of the sensitivity function in (1.6), we use the energy functional of
the form E(t) := p1  up dx + q1  |∇v|2q dx with p, q > 1, instead of that for the classical
d
Keller–Segel system with logistic source [4]. Firstly, we estimate dt
E(t).

Lemma 7.2. Let (u, v) be the local classical solution of (1.6). Then for p, q > 1, there exists
M11 > 0 such that

by Young’s inequality and (2.13) with some C23 > 0 for t ∈ (0, Tmax ). In addition, noticing
|∇v|2 = 2∇v · ∇v + 2|D 2 v|2 , we have from (1.6)2 that
d|∇v|2

= |∇v|2 − 2|D 2 v|2 − 2|∇v|2 + 2∇u · ∇v.
