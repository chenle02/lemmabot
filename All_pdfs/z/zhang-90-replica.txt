Interfaces subject to random disorder are analyzed by a replica scaling theory. Long-range and
short-range disorder corresponds to repulsive and attractive interaction among the replicas, respectively. If these interactions are treated properly, a scaling exponent is given for short-range
disorder, such as random bonds; the Flory exponent for long-range disorder, such as random
fields, is reproduced.

The problem of interfaces in random media arises in
various experimental
realizations in condensed-matter
physics. Of particular interest are the interfaces subject
to random fields (RF's) and random bonds (RB's). One is
interested in the scaling behavior of interface deviations in
the presence of disorder. A (d —1)-dimensional interface
immersed in the d-dimensional space in equilibrium can
be described by the partition function

One may wonder what is the justification of keeping
only the large n leading order, whereas the traditional re0 limit; thus the smallplica approaches consist of the n
est power contributes most. For our problems at hand we
expect that the RHS of (8) is a single positive power on
the exponent. However, within our scaling formalism we
can never be sure if our procedure has generated
artificially a subleading order. The key to this puzzle is
that such subleading order always has the opposite sign
and one can easily verify that a negative power does not
contribute to the scaling of P(F) defined in (8). Let us
see how a subleading order arises. In our preceding discussions we assumed the kinetic terms being proportional
to n But one .may argue that this factor should be n —1
since the motion of the center of mass should be ruled out.
We have assumed also that potential terms have a factor

With the above correction we would obtain (n —1)n~ ' in
place of ns on the RHS of (8). On the other hand, positive "subleading" order can indeed appear in some circumstances when it plays a dominant role in the P(F)
scaling and thus cannot be neglected: in an external field

complications in our present problems.
One may also wonder how the above replica scheme
works; does the difference between attraction and repulsion manifest itself in the original random systems? Understanding this question will help us better appreciate the
working of the present method and see its limitations. Let
us call the optimal configuration of the interface in the
random medium the ground state. Consider n identical
interfaces being placed in a single-random environment
without taking any average. For long-range disorder,
such as RF, in the vicinity of the ground state it is not very
likely that one would find energetically favorable (metastable) states '
they are more likely at large distances.
The thermal fluctuations will take the interfaces wandering over large distances. This is the origin of the repulsive
interaction among the n replicas. For short-range disorder, on the other hand, in the neighborhood of the ground
state there are many favorable states. ' The n replicas
tend to stay together, and hence the attractive interaction.
It is the non-Gaussian nature (9) of these fluctuations
about the ground state that necessitates the detour into replica space. Our replica scheme serves to invert the moments to find the distribution function. In the above
analysis we have tacitly assumed there is a unique ground
state in the random systems; we have also assumed replica
symmetry is unbroken in the replicated systems.
We can generalize the present analysis to the general
case of d'-dimensional manifold imbedded in d d' diwhich will not be discussed here. Of particumensions,
lar interest is the problem of directed polymers in d & 2

Further investigations
into the possible replica breaking

In this paper we have introduced a replica scaling
theory to analyze the interfaces in random media. We
have shown that short-range-correlated
disorder and longrange-correlated disorder have to be treated differently.
The former corresponds to attractive interaction among
the n replicas and the latter to repulsive interaction, respectively. From our analysis we conclude that the border
value is a, 0. For long-range disorder the Flory exponent is reproduced. For short-range disorder, in particular, for interfaces subject to random-bond disorder, a
scaling exponent is found. Since they are based on the
same level of assumptions we expect our result is as good
as the Flory exponent for RF in the whole range of validi-
