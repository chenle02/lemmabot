CONVERGENCE IN LAW OF THE MINIMUM OF A BRANCHING
RANDOM WALK
B Y E LIE A ÏDÉKON1
Eindhoven University of Technology
We consider the minimum of a super-critical branching random walk.
Addario-Berry and Reed [Ann. Probab. 37 (2009) 1044–1079] proved the
tightness of the minimum centered around its mean value. We show that a
convergence in law holds, giving the analog of a well-known result of Bramson [Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 44 (1983) iv+190] in the case of the branching
Brownian motion.

1. Introduction. We consider a branching random walk defined as follows.
The process starts with one particle located at 0. At time 1, the particle dies and
gives birth to a point process L. Then, at each time n ∈ N, the particles of generation n die and give birth to independent copies of the point process L, translated to
their position. If T is the genealogical tree of the process, we see that T is a Galton–
Watson tree, and we denote by |x| the generation of the vertex x ∈ T (the ancestor
is the only particle at generation 0). For each x ∈ T, we denote by V (x) ∈ R its
position on the real line. With this notation, (V (x), |x| = 1) is distributed as L.
The collection of positions (V (x), x ∈ T) defines our branching random walk.
We assume that we are in the boundary case (in the sense of [8])

These assumptions are discussed after Theorem 1.1. Under (1.1),
the mini
mum Mn goes to infinity, as it can be easily seen from the fact that |u|=n e−V (u)
goes to zero [22]. The law of large numbers for the speed of the minimum goes
back to the works of Hammersley [16], Kingman [19] and Biggins [6], and we
know that Mnn converges almost surely to 0 in the boundary case. The second order was recently found separately by Hu and Shi [17], and Addario-Berry and
Reed [1], and is proved to be equal to 32 ln n in probability, though there exist
almost sure fluctuations (Theorem 1.2 in [17]). In [1], the authors computed the
expectation of Mn to within O(1), and showed, under suitable assumptions, that
the sequence of the minimum is tight around its mean. Through recursive equations, Bramson and Zeitouni [11] obtained the tightness of Mn around its median,
when assuming some properties on the decay of the tail distribution. In the particular case where the step distribution is log-concave, the convergence in law of Mn
around its median was proved earlier by Bachmann [4]. The aim of this paper is to
get the convergence of the minimum Mn centered around 32 ln n for a general class
of branching random walks. This is the analog of the seminal work from Bramson [10], to which our approach bears some resemblance. To state our result, we
introduce the derivative martingale, defined for any n ≥ 0 by
Dn :=

(1.5)



V (x)e−V (x) .

|x|=n

From [7] (and Proposition A.3 in Appendix A), we know that the martingale converges almost surely to some limit D∞ , which is strictly positive on the set of
nonextinction of T. Notice that under (1.1), the tree T has a positive probability to
survive.

to a random shift of the Gumbel distribution.

We think that this assumption is superfluous, but our proof does not seem to work

1364

without this assumption; see equation (5.3). The condition of nonlattice distribution is necessary since it is hopeless to have a convergence in law around 32 ln n in
general. We do not know if an analogous result holds in the lattice case. If (1.3)
does not hold, we can expect, under suitable conditions, to have still a convergence
in law, but centered around κ ln n for some constant κ = 3/2. This comes from the
different behavior of the probability to remain positive for one-dimensional random walks with infinite variance. Finally, condition (1.4) appears naturally for
D∞ not being identically zero; see [7], Theorem 5.2.
The proof of the theorem is divided into three steps. First, we look at the tail
distribution of the minimum Mnkill of the branching random walk killed below
zero, that is, Mnkill := min{V (x), V (xk ) ≥ 0, ∀0 ≤ k ≤ |x|}, where xk denotes the
ancestor of x at generation k.
P ROPOSITION 1.2.

There exists a constant C1 > 0 such that

lim sup lim sup ez P Mnkill < ln n − z − C1 = 0.

This allows us to get the tail distribution of Mn in a second stage.
P ROPOSITION 1.3.

We have

lim sup lim sup P Mn < ln n − z − C1 c0 = 0,
2
z→∞ n→∞ z

where C1 is the constant in Proposition 1.2, and c0 > 0 is defined in (2.13).
Looking at the set of particles that cross a high level A > 0 for the first time, we
then deduce the theorem for the constant C ∗ = C1 c0 .
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces a useful and well-known
tool, the many-to-one lemma. Then, Sections 3, 4 and 5 contain, respectively, the
proofs of Propositions 1.2, 1.3 and Theorem 1.1. A sum-up of the notation used in
the paper can be found in Appendix D.
Throughout the paper, (ci )i≥0 denote positive constants. We say thatan ∼ bn
as n → ∞ if limn→∞ bann = 1. We write E[f, A] for E[f 1A ], and we set ∅ := 0,
∅ := 1.
2. The many-to-one lemma. For a ∈ R, we denote by Pa the probability distribution associated to the branching random walk starting from a, and
Ea the corresponding expectation. Under (1.1), there exists a centered random
walk (Sn , n ≥ 0) such that for any n ≥ 1, a ∈ R and any measurable function

where, under Pa , we have S0 = a almost surely. We will write P and E instead of P0 and E0for brevity. In particular, under (1.3), S1 has a finite variance
σ 2 := E[S12 ] = E[ |x|=1 V (x)2 e−V (x) ]. Equation (2.1) is called in the literature
the many-to-one lemma and can be seen as a consequence of Proposition 2.2 below.

comes from the branching property together with
The fact that Wn is a martingale

the assumption that E[ |x|=1 e−V (x) ] = 1. From [22], we know that Wn converges
almost surely as n → ∞ to 0 under our assumption (1.1). For any n ≥ 0, let Fn
denote the
σ -algebra generated by the positions (V (x), |x| ≤ n) up to time n, and

F∞ := n≥0 Fn . For any a ∈ R, the Kolmogorov extension theorem guarantees
that there exists a probability measure P̂a on F∞ such that for any n ≥ 0,
(2.3)

P̂a |Fn = ea Wn • Pa |Fn .

We will write P̂ instead of P̂0 . We associate to the probability P̂a the expectation Êa .

We introduce the point process L̂ with Radon–Nykodim derivative i∈L e−V (i)
with respect to the law of L, and we consider the following process. At time 0,
the population is composed of one particle w0 located at V (w0 ) = 0. Then, at
each step n, particles of generation n die and give birth to independent point processes distributed as L, except for the particle wn which generates a point process
distributed as L̂. The particle wn+1 is chosen among the children of wn with probability proportional to e−V (x) for each child x of wn . This defines a branching
random walk B̂ with a marked ray (wn )n≥0 , which we call the spine. On the space
of marked branching random walks, let Fˆn be the σ -algebra generated by the positions (V (x), |x| ≤ n) and the marked ray (or spine) (wk , k ≤ n) up to time n. Then,

B̂ is measurable with respect to Fˆ∞ := n≥0 Fˆn . We call B the natural projection
of B̂ on the space of branching random walks without marked rays; in other words
B is obtained from B̂ by forgetting the identity of the spine. In particular, B is
measurable with respect to F∞ . Notice that B is a branching random walk with
immigration. We use the notation a + B̂ or a + B to denote the branching random
walk which positions are translated by a.

Hence we will identify from now on our branching random walk under P̂a to the

P̂a to Fˆ∞ . We stress that in the filtration (Fn , n ≥ 0), we do not know the identity
of the spine. For  ≥ 1, we call (w ) the siblings of the spine at generation :
they are the vertices which share the same parent as w . We will often use the

This change of probability was used in [22]. We refer to [23] for the case of the
Galton–Watson tree, to [13] for the analog for the branching Brownian motion and
to [7] for spine decompositions in various types of branching. Before closing this
section, we collect some elementary facts about centered random walks with finite
variance. We recall that we deal with nonlattice random walks.

example, Lemmas 2.2 and 2.4 in [3]. Equation (2.10) is Lemma 4.3 of [2]: even if
the uniformity in a ∈ [0, an ] is not stated there, it follows directly from the proof.

2.2. A convergence in law for the one-dimensional random walk. We recall
that (Sn )n≥0 is a nonlattice centered random walk under P, with finite variance
E[S12 ] = σ 2 ∈ (0, ∞). We introduce its renewal function R(x) which is zero if
x < 0, 1 if x = 0 and for x > 0,

R(x) =

which is E[number of strict descending ladder heights which are ≥ −x]. Similarly, we define R− (x) as the renewal function associated to −S. Since E[S1 ] = 0
and E[S12 ] < ∞, we have that E[|H1 |] < ∞; see Theorem 1, Section XVIII.5,
page 612 in [14]. Then the renewal theorem [14], page 360, implies that there

3. The minimum of a killed branching random walk. It turns out to be
useful to study first the killed branching random walk. Let

Tkill := u ∈ T : V (uk ) ≥ 0, ∀0 ≤ k ≤ |u|



be the set of individuals that stay above 0. We investigate the behavior of the minimal position




Mnkill := min V (u), |u|kill = n ,

(3.1)

where we write |u|kill to say that u ∈ Tkill and |u| = n. If Mnkill < ∞; that is, if
the killed branching random walk survives until time n, we denote by mkill,(n) a
vertex chosen uniformly in the set {u : |u|kill = n, V (u) = Mnkill } of the particles
that achieve the minimum. It will be convenient to use the following notation: for

We will see later that, as n → ∞, conditionally on being in In (z), a particle that
achieves the minimum at time n did not cross the curve k → dk (n, z + L, λ) with
probability tending to 1 when the constant L goes to ∞ [and λ is any constant in
(0, 1)]. The section is devoted to the proof of the following proposition.

Notice that if u ∈ Znz,L , then necessarily u ∈ Tkill . In words, u ∈ Znz,L means that
a particle is located around 32 ln n − z, and did not cross the curve k → dk (n, z +
L, 1/2). We deduce from Lemma 3.3 that for any ε > 0, there exists L0 > 0 such

Equivalently, with high probability, any particle of the killed branching random
walk located around 32 ln n − z stayed above the curve k → dk (n, z + L, 1/2).
We show now that P(Mnkill ≤ 32 ln n − z) has an exponential decay as z → ∞.

of the second moment in (3.18). Such conditions on the behavior of the children off
the path of the spine in a second moment argument are not new, and were already
used in [15].
Remember the probability measure P̂ that we introduced in Section 2.1, which

there exists c13 > 0 such that P̂(wn ∈ Znz,0 ) ≥ 2c13 n−3/2 . Then, by Lemma C.1,
we can choose B > 0 such that for any n ≥ 1 and z ∈ [0, (3/2) ln n − 1],
P̂(wn is a z-good vertex) ≥ c13 n−3/2 .

3.2. Proof of Proposition 3.1. Corollary 3.4 and Lemma 3.6 already give the
right rate of decay, but we want to strengthen it into an asymptotic as z → ∞. We
recall that mkill,(n) is chosen uniformly among the particles in Tkill that achieve
the minimum. We introduced the notation Znz,L in Definition 3.5. By (3.14), we
have that with high probability mkill,(n) ∈ Znz,L whenever Mnkill ∈ In (z), where L
is a large constant. The first step of the proof is to give a representation of the
probability P(Mnkill ∈ In (z), mkill,(n) ∈ Znz,L ) in terms of the spine decomposition
presented in Section 2.1. Recall that the notation |u|kill = n is a short way to say
that u ∈ Tkill and |u| = n.

The proposition follows. 
5. Proof of Theorem 1.1. For β ≥ 0, we look at the branching random walk
killed below −β. The population at time n of this process is {|u| = n : V (uk ) ≥
−β, ∀k ≤ n}. We define the associated martingale (see Appendix A)
Dn(β) :=



|u|=n





R β + V (u) e−V (u) 1{V (uk )≥−β,k≤n} .

(β)

(β)

Since Dn is nonnegative, it has a limit almost surely that we denote by D∞ .
(β)
Under (1.3) and (1.4), we know by Proposition A.3 that D∞ > 0 almost surely on
the event of nonextinction for the branching random walk killed below −β. For
A ≥ 0, let Z [A] denote the set of particles absorbed at level A, that is,




Z [A] := u ∈ T : V (u) ≥ A, V (uk ) < A, ∀k < |u| .

In the words of Section 6 in [7], this set is a very simple optional line.
By Theorem 6.1 (and Lemma 6.1) of [7], we know that
u∈Z [A] R(β +
(β)
−V
(u)
V (u))e
1{V (uk )≥−β} converges to D∞ almost surely as A → ∞. Recall that
R(x) ∼ c0 x at infinity by (2.13). Recall from (2.2) that the martingale Wn is defined by
Wn :=



e−V (x)

|x|=n

and we know from [22] that Wn converges to 0 almost surely as n → ∞ un(β)
der (1.1). On the event {minu∈T V(u) ≥ −β}, we see that necessarily D∞ =
−V (u) 1
c0 D∞ almost surely, and
{V (uk )≥−β} ∼
u∈Z [A] R(β + V (u))e

−V
(u)
c0 u∈Z [A] (β + V (u))e
as A → ∞. Again by Theorem 6.1 (and Lemma 6.1)

of [7], we have limA→∞ u∈Z [A] e−V (u) = W∞ = 0 almost surely. We deduce that

APPENDIX A: THE DERIVATIVE MARTINGALE
We work under (1.1), (1.3) and (1.4), but we drop the assumption that L is
nonlattice. We recall from (2.11) that the renewal function R(x) is defined by
R(x) =

The duality lemma says that R(x) is also the expected number of visits of the
random walk (Sn )n≥0 to the interval (−x, 0] before hitting [0, ∞) (after time 1).
For any β ≥ 0, we introduce for n ≥ 0,

birth to a point process distributed as (V (x), |x| = 1) under P̂a . Then the spine

elementw1 at time 1 is chosen proportionally to R(V (u) + β)e−V (u) 1{V (u)≥−β}

among the children u of w0 . At each time n, the spine element wn produces

an independent point process distributed as (V (x), |x| = 1) under P̂ (β) , while

the other particles |u| = n generate independent point processes distributed as

to the weight R(V (u) + β)e−V (u) 1{V (uk )≥−β,∀k≤n} among the children of wn . We
(β)
write Fˆn for the σ -algebra obtained from Fn by including the information on

Under P̂y , the spine process (V (wn ), n ≥ 0) is distributed as the random walk

where p(x, dy) = Px (S1 ∈ dy). The fact that this defines a transition probability
comes from the equality Ex [R(S1 )1{S1 ≥0} ] = R(x) for any x ≥ 0 by Lemma 1
in [24]. This Markov chain then never hits the region (−∞, −β), hence its name.
(β)
Since (Dn , n ≥ 0) is a (nonnegative) martingale, it has a limit that we denote

by D∞ . The question of the convergence in L1 was addressed in [7], where the
authors give almost optimal conditions for the convergence to hold. However, we
deal with slightly weaker conditions, so we have to prove the convergence in our
case.

V (wk ) ≥ k a for k large enough. From (A.5), we deduce that A1 < ∞. We proceed similarly for A2 , replacing in (A.7) 1{X>z} by 1{X̃>z} . By analogy, we find

that A2 < ∞ if E[X(1 + ln+ X̃)2 ] and E[X̃(1 + ln+ X̃)] are finite. This is the case
(β)
by (1.4) and Lemma B.1(i). Equations (A.3) and (A.4) yield that D∞ < ∞ P̂(β) a.s., which ends the proof of (i). We prove now (iii). We see that, for any x ∈ T
with |x| = 1,
D∞ ≥ e−V (x) D∞,x ≥ 0,


where for any x ∈ T, Dn,x := |u|=n,u≥x (V (u) − V (x))e−(V (u)−V (x)) and

D∞,x := limn→∞ Dn,x . We used the fact that the martingale |u|=n,u≥x e−V (x)
converges to 0 as n → ∞. This implies that if D∞ = 0, then D∞,x = 0. Nowriting p := P(D∞ = 0), we
tice that D∞,x is distributed as D∞ . Therefore,

1
|x|=1
]. Consequently, p = 1 or p ≤
have that p > 0 implies that p ≤ E[p
P(extinction of T). On the other hand, observe that p ≥ P(extinction of T), since
the sum in (1.5) is empty for large n when the tree T is finite. Finally, we get
(0)
that P(D∞ = 0) is P(extinction of T) or 1. Now, notice that P(D∞ > 0) > 0
(0)
by (i). Since R(x) ≤ c27 (1 + x+ ), we see that D∞ ≤ c27 D∞ , and therefore
P(D∞ > 0) > 0. Hence, we have D∞ > 0 P-a.s. on the event of nonextinction.
We can now prove (ii). Let β ≥ 0. On the event of nonextinction of the branching
random walk killed below β, we can find a vertex u (in the killed branching random walk) such that there is an infinite line of descent from u which stays above
V (u). For such a vertex u, we have

We can assume that x̃ ≥ 1. If x̃ < x 2 , then x(ln+ x̃)2 ≤ 4x(ln+ x)2 . If x̃ ≥ x 2 , we

check that x(ln+ x̃)2 ≤ 2x̃ ln+ x̃ since ln(y) ≤ 2 y for any y ≥ 1. This gives (B.1).
It follows that

E X(ln+ X̃)2 ≤ 4E X(ln+ X)2 + 2E[X̃ ln+ X̃],

E[X̃ ln+ (X)] < ∞. We turn to the proof of (ii). Let ε > 0. We observe that

u to a vertex at generation n which stays above V (u) and ends below an (z);
T r : defined in (4.3);
z-good vertex: defined in (3.15);
En (z, b): defined in (3.21). Good event on which the particles at generation
n which are located below an (z) have a common ancestor with the spine at
generation greater than n − b;
FL,b : defined in (3.23);
CL,b : defined in (3.24).
Acknowledgments. I would like to thank the referee for helpful comments.
I thank also Loic de Raphelis and Zhan Shi for spotting mistakes in an earlier
version.
