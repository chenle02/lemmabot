NON-NEGATIVE SOLUTIONS OF LINEAR
PARABOLIC
by

EQUATIONS

D. G. ARONSON

Introduction.
The main results of this paper are several theorems concerning the properties of non-negative solutions of second order linear divergence structure
differential equations of parabolic type. One of the main results is the fact
that every non-negative solution of the Cauchy problem is uniquely determined by its initial data. Solutions of the Cauchy problem are functions
which correspond to a given initial function in some well defined way. There
are also solution of the differential equations in question which are nonnegative but which do not have initial values in any ordinary sense, for example, the Green’s function in a bounded domain or the fundamental solution
in an infinite strip. The properties of the Green)s function and the fundamental solution are developed in detail, and another of the main results is
the fact that these functions are bounded above and below by multiples
of the fundamental solution of an equation of the form ad 1c = ut, where a
is a positive constant. In addition, we prove that the Widder rapresentation
theorem is valid for the class of equations under consideration. Throughout
this paper we work with weak solutions of a very general class of parabolic
equations. When specialized to classical solutions of equations with smooth
coefficients our results are either new or generalizations of earlier results.
All of our results depend ultimately upon the work of Serrin and the author
on the local behavior of solutions of general divergence structure equations
and upon certain energy type estimates which are derived here.
Let x = (xy .... , x’,~~ denote points in the n-dimensional Euclidian space

(D). Clearly every classical solution of equation (1) in D is
weak solution. We will use the terms weak solution and solution
interchangably throughout this paper.
Various known properties of weak solution of equation (1) are summarized for convenient reference in section 1. These results, which are used
extensively in the remainder of the paper, include the maximum principle
and theorems on local behavior proved by Serrin and the author in refer
ence [6], and theorems on regularity at the boundary due to Trudinger [21].
Moreover, we establish a simple but useful extension principle which
permits us, in some cases, to use the local results of reference [6] in the
neighborhood of the boundary.
Section 2 is primarily devoted to the derivation of weighted energy type
estimates for weak solution of equation (1). In particular, if u is a solution
of (1) we derive estimates for the L2, ° norm of eh u and the L~~ 2 norm
of eA ux. Here 1~ = h (x, t) has the form

The next two sections are devoted to deriving various properties of the
weak Green’s functions and fundamental solutions. In section 7 we make
the temporary assumption that the coefficients of L are smooth and show
that the weak Green’s functions and fundamental solution coincide with
their classical counterparts. Several of the known properties of these functions are described. The main results of this section are upper and lower
bounds for these functions which are independent of the smoothness of the
coefficients of L. Specifically, we prove that there exist positive constants
atI a2 and C’ such that

for all (x, t), (~, r) E S with t &#x3E; 1:, where gi (x, t) is the fundamental solution
of o:, JM = ut for i = 17 2. The constants depend only on T and the quantities in condition (H). In the appendix to reference [16] Nash gives somewhat weaker bounds for r in case L is given by (7). A similar result holds
for the Green’s function y for L in a bounded cylinder Q. Here, however,
for the lower bound x and ~ must be restricted to a convex subdomain
Q’ of S2 and the constants depend on the distance from {J’ to
These
bounds were announced by the author in reference [4]. In section 8 we remove the assumption of smoothness of the coefficients of .L and prove that
the function y and .~ are limits of the corresponding functions for operator
obtained from b by regularizing the coefficients. From these considerations
it follows that y and 1’ inherit the principal properties of their classical
counterparts including the bounds described above.
In section 9 we combine the results obtained in sections 5 and 8 to
prove that if u is the non-negative weak solution of the Cauchy problem (6)

and Krzyzanski [14]. We also obtain a necessary and sufficient
condition for a function defined by a formula such as (9) to be a nonnegative solution of the Cauchy problem. Using (9) and the bounds for T
derived in section 8 we show that if u is a non-negative weak solution
of Lu = 0 in S then there exist a unique non-negative Borel measure g

(2.1) in Q then u satisfies

The

Cauchy

Problem.

In this section

we

consider the

Cauchy problem

where L satisfies (H ), and the F~ G, uo are given functions. The data will be
required to satisfy certain conditions which will be specified later. A function
u = u (x, t) is said to be a weak solutioit of problem (4.1) if it is a weak solution of equation (4.1)
and has initial values uo on t = 0. In particular, a weak solution of problem (4.1) is a global weak solution of equation
(4.1) in Q with initial values Uo on t = 0 for any bounded cylinder Q e S.
We are going to prove an existence and a uniqueness theorem for problem (4.1). Before doing so however let us recall some of the limitations on
uniqueness and solvability of the Cauchy problem for the one dimensional
equation of heat conduction

Tihonov has shown that if

u

which show that M(~0)==0 and
one cannot expect to have a unique solution of the Cauchy problem without
excluding solutions which grow too rapidly as -~ oo. The unique solution in the class of functions which satisfy (4.3) of equation (4.2) with the
initial condition it (x, 0) =
is given by

~c = 0 (e~ ~x~Z+‘ )

Clearly this solution is valid only for t E [0~1/4~). Thus if’ the data grow
exponentially for largex ~we cannot expect the solution of the Uauchy
problem to exist for arbitrary values of t. Analogous restrictions enter into
the statements of the results given below.
A function u = u (x, t) defined and measurable on b’ will be said to

Non-negative Solutions

of the

Cauchy Problem.

The results obtained in the previous three sections are not restricted
non-negative solutions of linear parabolic equations. Beginning with this
section, however, we shall use these general results together with the results quoted in section 1 to study the properties of various non-negative
solutions. Specifically, in this section we will characterize the non-negative
weak solutions of the Cauchy problem
to

next result which characterizes a non-negative solution of problem (5.1) as
the limit of a certain well-defined sequence ot’ functions associated with

7. Classical Fundamental Solution and Gi-een’s Functions.

We consider the operators Land L in strip S. If L satisfies (H.1)
and if the coefficients of L are bounded and smooth, then Land
classical fundamental solutions in 8 and Green’s functions in smoothly bounded cylinders Q. In this section we enumerate various known properties
of these functions and derive bounds for them. This information will be used
in the next section to show that the weak fundamental solutions and Green’s
functions are limits of the corresponding classical functions and share many
of their properties. Since the degree of smoothness beyond that required
for the construction of classical solutions is irrelevant, we will make the
usual quantitative assumption that L satisfies (H) and the temporary qualitative assumption that the coefficients of L are 000 (8) functions.
Under the assumptions given above, it is well known that there exists
a classical fundamental solution of Lu
0, that is, a function r(x, t; ~, ~)
defined for (x, t, ~, ~) E 8 x 8 except when both x = ~ and t = Ty which is
continuous for t &#x3E; z, and which has the folloving properties (cf. [10] and [12]).

theory for parabolic equations [10] that u is continuously differentiable with
respect to t and twice continuously differentiable with respect to x in any
compact subset of 8 = E n X [0, T]. Thus u is also the weak solution in 4f2 (S)

Fundamental Solution and Green’s Function.

In section 6 we showed that if L satisfies (H ) then there exists a
weak Green’s function y (x, t ; ~, z) for Lu = 0 in any bounded cylinder Q.
In particular, y belongs to certain Lq~
] spaces in Q and gives a representation formula for the solution of the boundary value problem (6.9).
Here we will derive additional properties of y which are analogous to
(G. 1-4) for the classical Green’s function. This derivation is based on the
fact that 7 can be approximated by classical Green’s functions. We will
also obtain similar resdlts for the weak fundamental solution of Lu = 0.
