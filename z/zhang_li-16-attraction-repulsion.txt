1 Introduction
Chemotaxis is a mechanism by which cells and organisms efficiently respond to chemical stimuli in their environment,
moving toward beneficial targets or environments and avoiding undesired ones [1]. In the present paper, we consider
chemoattraction-repulsion process in which cells undergo random motion and chemotaxis towards attractant and away
from repellent [12]. Moreover, we consider the model with proliferation and death of cells and assume that chemicals
diffuse very quickly [6, 19, 20]. These lead to the model of partial differential equations as follows:

positive. The logistic function f (s) : R → R is smooth and satisfies f (0) ≥ 0 as well as
f (s) ≤ μs(1 − s) for all s ≥ 0

During the past four decades, much attention has been focused on this classical chemotaxis model. A large amount of
efforts were devoted to making clear whether solutions to the so-called minimal model (f (u) = 0) are blowup or bounded
[4, 13, 16, 24, 27].
Since the blowup of solutions is an extreme phenomenon in real application, a lot of papers consider the model variations
in which the chemotactic collapse is precluded. The logistic function f (u) in (1.3) under some growth restrictions is expected
to prevent chemotactic collapse. In the case τ > 0, if the logistic term satisfies
f (u) ≤ a − μu2

(1.4)

with some a ≥ 0 and μ > 0, problem (1.3) possesses a unique global and bounded solution provided that either the
space dimensions n ≤ 2 [15, 25] or n ≥ 3 and μ > μ0 (τ, χ , n) [25]. The variation of (1.3) has also been considered
in [14], in which the production term u in the second equation of (1.3) is replaced by h(u). Under the assumptions
0 ≤ h(u) ≤ (u + 1)β , 0 ≤ h (u) ≤ β(u + 1)β−1 , and f (u) ≤ 1 − μuα with 32 ≤ α ≤ 2, and 0 < β < α − 1 or (α, β) =
( 32 , 12 ), solutions are global and bounded.
The case τ = 0 means essentially that chemical diffuses much faster than cells move. Under the assumption (1.4), Tello

classical solution, and moreover for all n ≥ 1, μ > 0 there exist at least one global weak solution. When the degradation
order of f is weaker than quadratic, i.e., −c0 (u + uα ) ≤ f (u) ≤ c1 − μuα for some c0 > 0, c1 ≥ 0 and μ > 0, Winkler
[22] constructed a very weak solution and studied the boundedness properties of such solution if α > 2 − n1 . In a recent
paper, Wang et al. [21] obtained the boundedness of solutions to the nonlinear-diffusion model with such proliferation
term. However, chemotactic collapse is not always ruled out by logistic term. Winkler [26] studied the system

[7] proved the global existence of classical solution in two dimensions and weak solution in three dimensions with large
initial data. Tao and Wang [19] considered the global solvability, boundedness, blow-up, existence of steady states, and
asymptotic behavior of system (1.6). It has been shown that if χ α − ξ γ < 0, system (1.6) with τ = 0 is globally well-posed
in high dimensions n ≥ 2, and system (1.6) with τ = 1 is globally well-posed in two dimensions when χ α − ξ γ < 0 and

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we state some preliminaries and prove local-in-time existence
of classical solution. In Sect. 3, we prove the boundedness of global solution. The global weak solution is constructed in
Sect. 4. Finally, in Sect. 5 we consider the large time behavior of solutions. Throughout the rest of this paper, C will denote
a generic constant which may vary from line to line and we also denote it by Cδ or C(δ) to indicate that it depends on a
real number δ.

2 Preliminaries
In this paper we need the following well-known facts concerning the Laplacian in  supplemented with homogeneous
Neumann boundary conditions (for instance, see [5, 23]). Firstly, the operator A := − + 1 is sectorial in Lp () and
therefore possesses closed fractional powers Aθ , θ ∈ (0, 1), with dense domain D(Aθ ). If m ∈ {0, 1}, p ∈ [1, ∞] and
q ∈ (1, ∞) with m − pn < 2θ − qn , then we have

Moreover, for p < ∞ the associated heat semigroup (e )t≥0 maps L () into D(A ) in any of the space L () for

This proves that  maps S into itself by choosing R > 0 sufficiently large and T suitably small. According to a similar
argument, using f is locally Lipschitz continuous in R, we deduce that  is a contraction on S. Therefore, by Banach fixed
point theorem, we infer that there exists u ∈ S such that (u) = u. From (2.4) and (2.5), we obtain the existence of v and
w. From the standard regularity argument, it follows that the solution (u, v, w) satisfies the regularity properties listed in
the lemma. The maximum principle to the first equation in (1.1) ensures u ≥ 0. Then using elliptic maximum principle to
the second equation and the third equation yields v ≥ 0 and w ≥ 0.
Now we prove the uniqueness of the solution. Suppose that (u1 , v1 , w1 ) and (u2 , v2 , w2 ) are two solutions of (1.1)
in  × (0, T ) for some T > 0. We fix T0 ∈ (0, T ), and let U = u1 − u2 , V = v1 − v2 , and W = w1 − w2 . A direct
calculation yields
Ut = U − χ ∇ · (U ∇v1 ) − χ ∇ · (u2 ∇V ) + ξ ∇ · (U ∇w1 ) + ξ ∇ · (u2 ∇W ) + f (u1 ) − f (u2 ).

3 Existence of global bounded solutions
In this section we shall show that the local solution constructed in Lemma 2.1 is global and uniformly bounded under the
assumptions of Theorem 1.1. We start with some estimates for w. The idea of proof is based on [28], which obtained the
similar results in the case n = 1.

4 Existence of global weak solutions for any μ > 0
In the case n−2
(χ α − ξ γ ) ≥ μ, Theorem 1.1 may not be true. Hence the purpose of the present section is to construct the
n
global weak solutions to (1.1) for arbitrary μ > 0. In this section, we assume that χ α − ξ γ > μ and n ≥ 3. The main idea
of the proof is base on the so-called regularized methods [9, 20].

(4.4) has a unique nonnegative global classical solution (uε , vε , wε ) which is uniformly bounded. However, the bound
depends on ε. In order to show that the solutions of (4.4) converge to the global weak solutions of (1.1) as ε → 0, we
furthermore establish some ε-independent estimates in the following.

5 Asymptotic behavior
According to the idea in [18], we study the large time behavior of solutions of (1.1) with f (u) = μu(1 − u). Throughout
this section we assume μ > 2χ α. Theorem 1.1 guarantees that the solution of (1.1) is global and uniformly bounded in
this case. Therefore, we can assume that
u := lim sup max u(x, t)
t→∞

¯
x∈

and
u := lim inf min u(x, t) ,
t→∞

¯
x∈

then, it is easy to see that 0 ≤ u ≤ u. Due to the following lemma, in order to prove Theorem 1.3, it is sufficient to verify
u = u.
Lemma 5.1. For each t ∈ (0, ∞), we have
α min u(y, t) ≤ βv(x, t) ≤ α max u(y, t)

(5.1)

γ min u(y, t) ≤ δw(x, t) ≤ γ max u(y, t)

P r o o f . Let ϕ ∈ C 2 ()
∂ν
¯ we necessarily have x0 ∈ . Hence, z(x0 ) ≤ 0. Since
x0 ∈ ,
βz = z + αu − ε(ϕ − βϕ),
we conclude at the point x0
βz(x) ≤ βz(x0 ) ≤ αu(x0 ) − ε(ϕ − βϕ)(x0 )
≤ α max u(y, t) + ε max |ϕ − βϕ|.
¯
y∈

¯
y∈

By letting ε → 0, we get
βv(x, t) ≤ α max u(y, t).

By similar arguments, we obtain the left inequality of (5.1) and the inequality (5.2).

P r o o f . This is an immediate consequence of Lemma 5.1.
Based on Corollary 5.2, we can show the following lemma, which makes precise some relations between u and u.
Lemma 5.3. Let μ > 2χ α. Then we have u = u = 1.
P r o o f . We define a second-order elliptic differential operator by
Lu := u + (−χ ∇v(x, t) + ξ ∇w(x, t)) · ∇u.
The first equation in (1.1) then reads as
ut − Lu = −χ uv + ξ uw + μu(1 − u).
Using the second and third equations, we obtain

ut − Lu = u μ − (μ − (χ α − ξ γ ))u − χβv + ξ δw .

(5.6)

For fixed ε > 0, there exists tε taken from Lemma 5.2 we obtain by (5.4) and (5.5) that
−χβv ≤ −χ α(u − ε)
and
ξ δw ≤ ξ γ (u + ε)
in  × (tε , ∞). Therefore, (5.6) yields

ut − Lu ≤ u μ − (μ − (χ α − ξ γ ))u − χ α(u − ε) + ξ γ (u + ε) .
A parabolic comparison argument shows that
u(x, t) ≤ y1 (t)

(5.7)

¯ × (tε , ∞), where y1 is the solution of
for all (x, t) ∈ 


y1 = y1 μ − (μ − (χ α − ξ γ ))y1 − χ α(u − ε) + ξ γ (u + ε) ,
y1 (tε ) = maxx∈¯ u(x, tε ).
¯ by the strong maximum principle, we have
Since u(x, tε ) > 0 in 


μ − χ α(u − ε) + ξ γ (u + ε)
y1 → max 0,
μ − (χ α − ξ γ )
as t → ∞. From (5.7), it follows that


μ − χ α(u − ε) + ξ γ (u + ε)
,
u ≤ max 0,
μ − (χ α − ξ γ )
then upon letting ε → 0, we obtain
(μ − (χ α − ξ γ )) u ≤ (μ − χ αu + ξ γ u)+ .

(5.8)

We once more use (5.4) and (5.5) to obtain
−χβv ≥ −χ α(u + ε)
and
ξ δw ≥ ξ γ (u − ε)
in  × (tε , ∞). This, along with (5.6), yields

ut − Lu ≥ u μ − (μ − (χ α − ξ γ ))u − χ α(u + ε) + ξ γ (u − ε) .

Let y2 be the solution of the initial-value problem


y2 = y2 μ − (μ − (χ α − ξ γ ))y2 − χ α(u + ε) + ξ γ (u − ε) ,
y2 (tε ) = minx∈¯ u(x, tε ).
¯ × (tε , ∞). Similarly as for (5.8), we obtain
It follows from the comparison principle that u(x, t) ≥ y2 in (x, t) ∈ 
(μ − (χ α − ξ γ ))u ≥ μ − χ αu + ξ γ u.

(5.9)

We claim that μ > χ αu − ξ γ u. In fact, assume the contrary. In view of (5.8), we have u = u = 0, this is a contraction to
(5.9). Hence, we get
(μ − (χ α − ξ γ ))u ≤ μ − χ αu + ξ γ u.

(5.10)

We subtract (5.10) from (5.9) to obtain
(μ − (χ α − ξ γ ))(u − u) ≤ χ α(u − u) + ξ γ (u − u).
Since μ > 2χ α according to our assumption, we obtain u = u. From (5.10), we have u ≤ 1, and by (5.9) we see u ≥ 1.

Then it follows that u = u = 1.
P r o o f o f T h e o r e m 1 . 3 . In view of Lemma 5.1, Lemma 5.3 and the definitions of u, u, we complete the proof
of Theorem 1.3.
