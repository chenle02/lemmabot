QUASI-LINEAR (STOCHASTIC) PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS WITH TIME-FRACTIONAL DERIVATIVES∗
WEI LIU† , MICHAEL RÖCKNER‡ , AND JOSÉ LUÍS DA SILVA§
Abstract. In this paper we develop a method to solve (stochastic) evolution equations on
Gelfand triples with time-fractional derivative based on monotonicity techniques. Applications
include deterministic and stochastic quasi-linear partial differential equations with time-fractional
derivatives, including time-fractional (stochastic) porous media equations (including the case where
the Laplace operator is also fractional) and p-Laplace equations as special cases.

1. Introduction. Fractional Calculus has a long history, and its origins can be
traced back to the end of the 17th century (cf. [51]). Although the first main steps
of the theory date back to the first half of the 19th century, this subject became
very active only over the last few decades. One of the main reasons is that scientists
and engineers have developed many new models that naturally involve fractional differential equations, which have been applied successfully, e.g., in mechanics (theory
of viscoelasticity and viscoplasticity) (cf. [36]), biochemistry (modeling of polymers
and proteins) (cf. [21, 22]), electrical engineering (transmission of ultrasound waves)
(cf. [20]), medicine (modeling of human tissue under mechanical loads) (cf. [18, 35]),
etc. For more applications and references we refer the reader to [3, 26, 39, 40].
A typical example of a time-fractional equation is the time-fractional heat equation ∂tβ u = ∆u with 0 < β < 1, where ∂tβ is the Caputo fractional derivative that first
appeared in [13] and is defined for 0 < β < 1 by

∂tβ f (t) =

where Γ is the Gamma function defined by Γ(λ) := 0 tλ−1 e−t dt. Here one implicitly
assumes that f is such that the integral on the right-hand side is (weakly) differentiable
in t. For the precise domain of f for which ∂tβ f is defined and which is convenient in
our case, we refer the reader to (2.11) below.
The classical heat equation ∂t u = ∆u describes heat propagation in a homogeneous medium. The time-fractional diffusion equation ∂tβ u = ∆u with 0 < β < 1

QUASI-LINEAR SPDE WITH TIME-FRACTIONAL DERIVATIVES

has been widely used to model anomalous diffusions exhibiting subdiffusive behavior,
e.g., due to particle sticking and trapping phenomena (cf. [39, 53]). While in normal
diffusions (described by the heat equation or more general parabolic equations), the
mean squared displacement of a diffusive particle behaves like const·t for t → ∞, the
time-fractional diffusion equation exhibits a behavior like const·tβ for t → ∞. This
is the reason why time-fractional equations with 0 < β < 1 are called subdiffusion
equations in the literature and for the case 1 < β < 2 are called superdiffusion equations. In fact, there is a diverse number of real-world systems which demonstrate this
type of phenomenon. For example, the above time-fractional equations and nonlinear
variants of them are also widely used to model dynamical processes in materials with
memory, e.g., the diffusion of fluids in porous media with memory (see [12]). We refer
the reader to the survey article [41] and the monographs [3, 44, 47, 48, 52, 66] for
more references.
We also want to mention the interesting interplay between stochastic processes
and time-fractional differential equations. A celebrated result of Einstein established
a mathematical link between random walks, the diffusion equation, and Brownian
motion. The probability densities of the Brownian motion solve a diffusion equation
(heat equation), and hence we refer to the Brownian motion as the stochastic solution
to the heat equation. Similarly, the stochastic solutions of time-fractional diffusion
equations are subordinated processes (e.g., iterated Brownian motion). The solutions
to fractional diffusion equations are strictly related to stable densities. Indeed, the
stochastic solutions of time-fractional diffusions can be realized through “time-change”
by inverse stable subordinators. Just as Brownian motion is a scaling limit of simple
random walks, the stochastic solutions to certain fractional diffusion equations are
scaling limits of continuous time random walks, in which the i.i.d. jumps are separated
by i.i.d. waiting times. For this subject we refer the reader to [2, 38, 45] and the
references therein.
In recent years, there has also been growing interest in stochastic time-fractional
partial differential equations (see, e.g., [19, 55]). For example, the author in [65]
considers stochastic Volterra equations with singular kernels in a 2-smooth Banach
space. The authors in [17] study the L2 -theory for a class of semilinear stochastic
partial differential equations with time-fractional derivatives, which can be used to
describe random effects on transport of particles in media with thermal memory, or
particles subject to sticking and trapping. In [42, 43], the authors consider a spacetime fractional stochastic heat type equation to model phenomena with random effects
with thermal memory, and they prove existence and uniqueness of mild solutions
and also some intermittency property (see also [23]). For a linear stochastic partial
differential equation of fractional order both in the time and space variables with a
different type of noise term we refer the reader to [15, 25]. In [14, 16] the authors
investigate linear stochastic time-fractional partial differential equations for the more
general case 0 < β ≤ 2.
In this paper, we are mainly interested in nonlinear stochastic time-fractional
partial differential equations in a variational setting which include in particular important examples of quasi-linear type such as stochastic porous media equations and
the p-Laplace equation. They are of the following form:

Caputo fractional derivative, and A : [0, T ] × V → V ∗ and B : [0, T ] → LHS (U ; H)
(here LHS (U ; H) denotes the space of all Hilbert–Schmidt operators from U to H)
are measurable. For simplicity we only consider the additive type noise in (1.2) here;
the case of general multiplicative noise will be investigated in a forthcoming paper.
We will establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to (1.2) under classical
monotonicity and coercivity conditions on A (see Theorems 2.1 and 2.7). The proof
of the main results will be based on a functional analytic approach, which, to the
best of our knowledge, is new to solve both the deterministic and stochastic timefractional partial differential equations in the variational setting. This approach is
inspired by the work of Stannat [56] on the theory of generalized Dirichlet forms,
which in turn draws essential ideas from [29]. We will establish a general existence
result concerning an abstract operator equation (see Theorem 2.3 below) which is
central to our approach.
We should mention that time-fractional linear evolution equations in the Gelfand
triple setting were first investigated in [61]. Later on, the author also proved the global
solvability of a nondegenerate parabolic equation with time-fractional derivative in
[62] (cf. [1] for the more general case). However, these results cannot be applied
to quasi-linear type equations like the porous media or the p-Laplace equation. In
[27] the authors investigate elliptic-parabolic integro-differential equations with L1 data. Their framework includes the time-fractional p-Laplace equation. However,
the authors in [27] consider generalized solutions (i.e., entropy solutions). Therefore,
the results of this paper generalize or complement the corresponding results in [27,
61, 62] in the setting of time-fractional quasi-linear partial differential equations with
monotone coefficients. Recently, the authors in [60] derived very interesting decay
estimates for the solutions of time-fractional porous medium and p-Laplace equations
(by assuming the existence), and the decay behavior is notably different from the case
with the usual time derivative. Hence, here we, in particular, give a positive answer to
the question of the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the time-fractional porous
medium equations and p-Laplace equations, which are left open in [60].
If β = γ = 1, then both the deterministic and stochastic equations (1.2) have
been intensively investigated in the variational setting. For the deterministic case, one
might refer to the monographs [4, 9, 29, 54, 63] and the references therein. But also the
stochastic case (i.e., the stochastic partial differential equations) has attracted more
and more attention in recent years; we refer the reader to some classical references
[7, 28, 46] and to recent works [6, 11, 24, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 50, 64] (see also the
references therein).
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we present the main results on
the existence and uniqueness of solutions to deterministic and stochastic nonlinear
evolution equations with time-fractional derivatives. In section 3 we will apply our
main results to stochastic time-fractional porous medium equations and p-Laplace
equations as model examples. The well-posedness of both equations has been an open
problem even in the deterministic case.
2. Main results. Let (H, h·, ·iH ) be a real separable Hilbert space identified with
its dual space H ∗ by the Riesz isomorphism. Let V be a real reflexive Banach space,
continuously and densely embedded into H. Then we have the following Gelfand
triple:
V ⊆ H ≡ H ∗ ⊆ V ∗.

QUASI-LINEAR SPDE WITH TIME-FRACTIONAL DERIVATIVES

Let V ∗ h·, ·iV denote the dualization between V and its dual space V ∗ . Then it is easy
to show that
V ∗ hu, viV = hu, viH , u ∈ H, v ∈ V.
Now, for T ∈ [0, ∞) fixed, we consider the following general nonlinear evolution
equation with time-fractional derivative:
∂tβ (u(t) − x) + A(t, u(t)) = f (t), 0 < t < T,

V → V ∗ is restrictedly measurable, i.e., for each dt-version of u ∈ L1 ([0, ∞); V ),
t 7→ A(t, u(t)) is V ∗ -measurable on [0, ∞), and f ∈ L1 ([0, ∞); V ∗ ).
Applying the Riemann–Liouville fractional integral Itβ , defined by

derivative. Defining ũ to be equal to the right-hand side of (2.2), this dt-version of
u satisfies ũ(0) = x. Concerning the continuity properties of ũ, we refer the reader
to Theorem 2.1 below. We also remark that below we work with functions u only
determined dt-a.e., so u(0) can be chosen arbitrarily. Therefore, we write x in (2.1)
instead of u(0).
Now let us formulate the precise conditions on the coefficients in (2.1). Suppose
for fixed α > 1 that there exist constants δ > 0, C and g ∈ L1 ([0, ∞); R+ ) such that
the following conditions hold for all t ∈ [0, ∞) and v, v1 , v2 ∈ V :

Then for x = 0 (the case for general initial condition x will then follow easily as
we shall see below), the original equation (2.1) can be rewritten in the following form:
∂tβ u + Au = f,

(2.3)
where

A : V → V ∗ ; (Au)(t) = A(t, u(t)), t ∈ [0, ∞).
It is easy to see that A : V → V ∗ is monotone, coercive, and bounded on bounded
sets.
We shall see below that ∂tβ with domain {u ∈ H | r 7→ |r|β û(r) ∈ L2 (R; H)} ∩ V
is closable as an operator from V to V ∗ . Let (∂tβ , F) denote its closure with norm

Theorem 2.1. Suppose that T ∈ [0, ∞) and that A : [0, ∞) × V → V ∗ satisfies
(H1)–(H4). Then for every x ∈ V and f ∈ V ∗ , (2.1) has a unique solution u such
that u − xϕ ∈ F for every ϕ ∈ Lα ([0, ∞); R) with ϕ ≡ 1 on [0, T + 1). In particular,

Remark 2.1. (i) As a matter of fact, the monotonicity assumption (H2) of A is a
sufficient condition to imply that A : V → V ∗ is pseudo-monotone. The above theorem
still holds if we replace (H2) by assuming A : V → V ∗ is pseudo-monotone. In [33, 34],
a local monotonicity condition is assumed for A which yields that A(t, ·) : V → V ∗ is
pseudo-monotone provided V ⊆ H is a compact embedding. However, it is still not
clear whether it implies that A : V → V ∗ is pseudo-monotone.
(ii) It is easy to see from the proof that to have uniqueness of solutions one can
replace (H2) by the following weak monotonicity:

V ∗ hA(t, v1 ) − A(t, v2 ), v1 − v2 iV + Kkv1 − v2 kH ≥ 0,

we have ∂Φ(u) = A(u), ∀u ∈ V. Then
A(u) − Λu = f
⇔ ∂Φ(u) − Λu = f
⇔ u = arg min {Φ(v) + Φ∗ (f + Λv) − V ∗ hΛv, viV − V ∗ hf, viV } ,
v∈V

where Φ∗ (η) := supv∈V {V ∗ hη, viV − Φ(v)}.
Now we recall the definition of a “pseudo-monotone operator,” which is a very
useful generalization of a “monotone operator” and was first introduced by Brézis in
[8]. We use the notation “*” for weak convergence in Banach spaces.
Definition 2.1. The operator M : V → V ∗ is called pseudo-monotone if vn * v
in V as n → ∞ and
lim sup V ∗ hM (vn ), vn − viV ≤ 0
n→∞

implies for all u ∈ V
V ∗ hM (v), v − uiV ≤ lim inf V ∗ hM (vn ), vn − uiV .
n→∞

Remark 2.2. Browder introduced a slightly different definition of a pseudo-monotone
operator in [10]: An operator M : V → V ∗ is called pseudo-monotone if vn * v in V
as n → ∞ and
lim sup V ∗ hM (vn ), vn − viV ≤ 0
n→∞

implies
M (vn ) * M (v) and

lim V ∗ hM (vn ), vn iV = V ∗ hM (v), viV .

n→∞

In particular, if M is bounded on bounded sets, then these two definitions are equivalent; we refer the reader to [30, 33, 34].
Lemma 2.2. If M : V → V ∗ is pseudo-monotone, bounded on bounded sets, and
coercive, then M is surjective, i.e., for any f ∈ V ∗ , the equation M u = f has a
solution.
Proof. This is a classical result due to Brézis. For the proof we refer the reader
to [8] or [63, Theorem 27.A].
As in [56] we consider a generator Λ, with domain D(Λ, H), of a C0 -contraction
semigroup of linear operators on H whose restrictions to V form a C0 -semigroup
of linear operators on V. The generator of the latter is again Λ, but with domain
D(Λ, V) := {u ∈ V | Λu ∈ V}. Then D(Λ, V) is dense in V; hence so is D(Λ, H) ∩ V.
By [56, Lemma 2.3], Λ : D(Λ, H) ∩ V → V ∗ is closable as an operator from V
to V ∗ . Denoting its closure by (Λ, F), F is a Banach space with norm kukF :=
1
(kuk2V + kΛuk2V ∗ ) 2 , u ∈ F.
We will use the following abstract result in which Λ will later be taken to be −∂tβ
to solve (2.1). This abstract result is a generalization of [56, Proposition 3.2]. We
replace the strong monotonicity assumption in [56, Proposition 3.2] by the classical
monotonicity (H2) (see also Remark 2.1) and consider a reflexive Banach space V in
place of the Hilbert space V in [56].
Theorem 2.3. For any f ∈ V ∗ , there exists a solution u ∈ F of the equation
Au − Λu = f .

Proof. Step 1. For α > 0, consider the Yosida approximation Λα : V → V ∗
defined by
Λα = α(αVα − I),
where Vα = (α − Λ)−1 , α > 0, is the resolvent of (Λ, D(Λ, H)) (on H).
Note that A − Λα is pseudo-monotone, coercive, and bounded on bounded sets.
By Lemma 2.2 there exists uα ∈ V such that Auα − Λα uα = f .
Step 2. Note that
V ∗ hAuα , uα iV ≤ V ∗ hAuα − Λα uα , uα iV = V ∗ hf, uα iV ≤ kf kV ∗ kuα kV .

Hence, by the coercivity assumption (H3) we obtain that supα>0 kuα kV < ∞, and
hence supα>0 kAuα kV ∗ < ∞ by (H4).
Since for any v ∈ V
V ∗ hΛα uα , viV = −V ∗ hAuα − Λα uα , viV + V ∗ hAuα , viV

= −V ∗ hf, viV + V ∗ hAuα , viV
≤ (kf kV ∗ + kAuα kV ∗ )kvkV ,
we have supα>0 kΛα uα kV ∗ < ∞.
By the a priori estimates above we know there exists a subsequence αn → ∞ such
that
uαn * u in V;
Auαn * h in V ∗ ;
Λαn uαn * g in V ∗ .
So, it is easy to see that h − g = f .
Note that Λ is a linear operator and
αn Vαn uαn * u in V,
so we have
Λαn Vαn uαn * g in V ∗ ,
since Λαn Vαn uαn = Λαn uαn . Hence Λu = g. Note that kαn Vαn uαn kV ≤ 2Ckuαn kV ;
hence we have
sup kαn Vαn uαn kF < ∞,
n

which implies that u ∈ F. Recall that kuk2F := kuk2V + kΛuk2V ∗ .
Step 3. Now we only need to show Au = h.
Since uαn * u,
lim sup V ∗ hAuαn , uαn − uiV
n→∞

= lim sup V ∗ hΛαn uαn + f, uαn − uiV
n→∞

= lim sup V ∗ hΛαn uαn , uαn − uiV
n→∞

≤V ∗ hΛu, u − uiV = 0,
where the inequality follows from V ∗ hΛαn (uαn − u), uαn − uiV ≤ 0.

So, we have
lim sup V ∗ hAuαn , uαn iV ≤ V ∗ hh, uiV .
n→∞

Hence, by the pseudo-monotonicity, we have for any w ∈ V
V ∗ hAu, u − wiV

≤ lim inf V ∗ hAuαn , uαn − wiV
n→∞

≤ lim inf V ∗ hAuαn , uαn iV − V ∗ hh, wiV
n→∞

≤V ∗ hh, u − wiV ,
which implies Au = h since w ∈ V was arbitrary.
Now we want to show that we can take Λ := −∂tβ ; i.e., we have to show that
β
−∂t generates a C0 -semigroup of contractions on H which can be restricted to a C0 semigroup on V. To this end, let us define the following “shift to the right” semigroup
Ut , t > 0, on H. For f ∈ H, t ≥ 0, define
Ut f (r) := 1[0,∞) (r − t)f (r − t), r ∈ [0, ∞).

(2.6)

Then it is trivial to check that (Ut )t>0 is a C0 -contraction semigroup on H and it
obviously can be restricted to a C0 -semigroup on V (even in this case consisting also
of contractions on V). Now fix β ∈ (0, 1) and define for f ∈ H
Z ∞

(2.7)
Ut f :=
Us f ηtβ (ds), t ≥ 0,

where (ηtβ )t>0 denotes
the one-sided stable semigroup (of probability measures on

η̂tβ (s) =

hence ηtβ (ds) is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure ds. It is a
well-known fact (see, e.g., [37, Chap. II, sect. 4b]) that (Utβ )t>0 is also a C0 -semigroup
of contractions on H which obviously can be restricted to a C0 -semigroup on V (again
consisting of contractions).
Proposition 2.4. The generator (Λ, D(Λ, H)) of (Utβ )t>0 (on H) is given as
follows:
D(Λ, H) = {u ∈ H | r 7→ |r|β û(r) ∈ L2 (R; H)},
(Λu)∧ (r) = −(ir)β û(r), r ∈ R,

Proof. Below we consider each ηtβ (ds) as a measure on all of R by defining
ηtβ (A) := ηtβ (A ∩ [0, ∞)), A ∈ B(R),
and any function f in H as a function on R by defining f := 0 on (−∞, 0).
Let D := {u ∈ H | r 7→ |r|β û(r) ∈ L2 (R; H)}. Then for u ∈ D we have

the last convergence also holds in H. Hence D ⊂ D(Λ, H) and
(Λu)∧ (r) = −(ir)β û(r), r ∈ R.

(2.9)
Similarly, one checks that

Utβ D ⊆ D

(2.10)

∀t > 0,

and that (Λ, D) is closed as an operator from H to H. Since D is dense in H,
(2.10) implies (see [49, Theorem X.49]) that D is an operator core of (Λ, D(Λ, H)).
Consequently, D = D(Λ, H) and Λ is given by (2.9). Furthermore, we note that for
all β > 0
D(Λ, H) ⊂ H β (R; H)
by definition of the fractional Sobolev space H β (R; H)(⊂ L2 (R; H)), which consists of
(Hölder-) continuous functions on R if β > 21 . Therefore, if β > 21 , every u ∈ D(Λ, H)
has a continuous version ũ on R which is zero on (−∞, 0); hence ũ(0) = 0.
Next we shall prove a representation formula for Λ in terms of the Caputo derivative ∂tβ . To this end, we first define a domain for ∂tβ which is convenient in our case.
Let for β ∈ (0, 1)
(2.11)
D(∂tβ ) := {u ∈ L1 ([0, ∞); V ∗ ) | g1−β ∗ u ∈ W 1,1 ([0, T ], V ∗ ) for all T ∈ (0, ∞)},
where we define for u ∈ L1 ([0, ∞); V ∗ )
(g1−β ∗ u)(t) :=

Obviously, for all T ∈ (0, ∞)
g1−β ∗ u = (1[0,T ] g1−β ) ∗ (1[0,∞) u)

on [0, T ],

where for p ∈ [1, ∞) the latter function belongs to Lp (R; V ∗ ) if 1[0,∞) u does, and is
in C(R; V ∗ ) if in addition β ∈ (0, p−1
p ).

Λu = −

for dt-a.e. t ∈ [0, T ],

and the same inequality holds with k · kH replacing k · kV ∗ .
From now on we consider all appearing functions, originally only defined on [0, ∞),
as functions on all of R by defining them to be equal to zero on R \ [0, ∞). As in the
proof of Proposition 2.4, one can check that Utβ (D0 ) ⊂ D0 (for which, however, it is
essential that ηtβ (ds) is absolutely continuous with respect to ds) and that D0 is dense
in H. Again applying Theorem X.49 from [49], we obtain that D0 is an operator core
of (Λ, D(Λ, H)). Hence it remains to prove (2.12).
Let us start with calculating the Laplace transform L of the right-hand side of
(2.12) for any u ∈ D(∂tβ ) ∩ L∞ ([0, ∞); V ∗ ). So let λ ∈ (0, ∞). Then integrating by
parts, using (2.13) and Fubini’s theorem, we obtain

In particular, g1−β ∗ u ∈ C([0, ∞), H).
Proof. By Lemma 2.5 there exist un ∈ D0 , n ∈ N, such that as n → ∞
un −→ u in V
and
−∂tβ un = Λun −→ Λu in V ∗ .
Let T ∈ (0, ∞). Obviously, g1−β ∗ un −→ g1−β ∗ u in Lα ([0, T ]; V ) as n → ∞.

Proof of Theorem 2.1. Existence. Let ϕ be as in the assertion of the theorem.
Define Ax as A, but with
Ax (t, v) := A(t, v + xϕ(t)), t > 0, v ∈ V,
replacing A. Then by Theorem 2.3 and Proposition 2.6 there exist ux ∈ F such that

Define u := ux + xϕ. Then u − xϕ(= ux ) satisfies (2.4) and

i.e., (2.1) is solved. The rest of the assertions of the theorem follow from the last part
of the assertion of Proposition 2.6 and an elementary fact about convolutions.
Uniqueness. The uniqueness proof is similar to the argument in [61, Theorem
3.1]. So, we only give a brief account of the proof here.
Recall the Riemann–Liouville fractional integral Itβ f := gβ ∗ f and the definition
of the Riemann–Liouville kernel
gβ (t) =

Suppose that u1 , u2 are solutions to (2.1); then u := u1 − u2 is a solution to the
following equation:
∂tβ u + A(t, u1 ) − A(t, u2 ) = 0, u(0) = 0.
Let g n ∈ W 1,1 , n ∈ N , be the kernel associated with the Yosida approximation of the

Hence, by applying convolution with the kernel gβ to (2.14) we have
ku(t)k2H ≤ 0, a.e. t ∈ [0, T ],
which implies that u1 = u2 , i.e., the solution to (2.1) is unique.
Suppose that U is a Hilbert space and W (t) is a U -valued cylindrical Wiener process defined on a filtered probability space (Ω, F, Ft , P). Now we consider stochastic
nonlinear evolution equations with fractional time derivative of type

where γ ∈ (0, 1] and B : [0, T ] → LHS (U ; H) is measurable (here (LHS (U ; H), k · kHS )
denotes the space of all Hilbert–Schmidt operators from U to H).
We want to explain the reason that this form of random noise term is used in
(2.15). In fact, heuristically

which can be used to model systems subject to classical random noise (the case γ =
1) or random noise with certain memory effects (the case γ < 1). This form of
noise will naturally appear if, e.g., you consider the heat transfer with random effects
with memory (see [17]) or use the time-fractional Duhamel principle to derive the
appropriate form of stochastic time-fractional diffusion equations (see [42] for the
case γ = β). The case γ = β is investigated in various papers about stochastic heat
type or wave type equations (see, e.g., [14, 16, 23, 42, 43]), and the case γ = 1 is
studied in [15, 25].
In this work we consider the general case γ < β + 21 ; this assumption is natural
since the stochastic integral term in (2.16) is well defined if and only if (e.g., assuming
B(·) is bounded)

In particular,

Furthermore, t 7→ Γ(1−β)

H-valued dt-versions, and t 7→ X(t) has a continuous V ∗ -valued dt-version if β ∈
( α−1
α , 1).
Proof. Let u(t) = X(t) − F (t); then u(t) satisfies the following equation:
(2.17)

∂tβ (u(t) − x) + A(t, u(t) + F (t)) = 0, 0 < t < T.

Define
Ã(t, u) = A(t, u + F (t)), u ∈ V.
Since F ∈ V dt ⊗ P-a.e., it is easy to see that Ã still satisfies (H1)–(H4). Hence (2.17)
has a unique solution u, which implies that u + F is the unique solution to (2.15).
The Ft -adaptiveness of the solution follows by the proofs of Theorem 2.3 and
Lemma 2.2. Since gα ∗ gβ = gα+β , it easily follows (e.g., by [34, Proposition 6.3.3])
that F is P-a.s. continuous in H. Hence X is continuous in V ∗ if β ∈ ( α−1
α , 1).
Remark 2.3. From the above proof one can see that Theorem 2.7 also holds for
the case that A and B are random coefficients (i.e., also depend on ω ∈ Ω) in a
progressively measurable way (cf. [34, section 4.1]). It’s also obvious that one could
take the initial condition x as some V -valued random variable.
3. Application to examples. In this part we will apply our main result to
establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to (stochastic) porous medium
equations and p-Laplace equations with time-fractional derivative. Both are open
problems even in the deterministic case. In the recent work [60], the authors derive
very nice decay estimates for the solution of those equations (by assuming the existence), and the decay behavior turns out to be notably different from the classical
parabolic case. As said, here we give a positive answer to the question concerning the
existence and uniqueness of solutions to the time-fractional porous medium equations
and p-Laplace equations.
Both examples are just model cases which we present here motivated by [60].
There are many more examples (see, e.g., [5] and [50]). In particular, fast diffusion
equations are also covered. We are confident that we can extend our approach to the
case of multivalued operators as well.
Let Λ ⊂ Rd be an open bounded domain and ∆ be the Laplace operator, and
for p ∈ [1, ∞[ we use Lp (Λ) and H0n,p (Λ) to denote the pth-integrable Lebesgue space
and the Sobolev space of order n in Lp (Λ) with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Recall
that X ∗ denotes the dual space of a Banach space X.
3.1. Time-fractional porous medium equation. We first introduce the porous
medium operator A(u) := ∆Ψ(u). Let Ψ : R → R be a function having the following
properties:

(Ψ1) Ψ is continuous.
(Ψ2) For all s, t ∈ R
(t − s)(Ψ(t) − Ψ(s)) ≥ 0.
(Ψ3) There exist p ∈ [2, ∞[, c1 ∈ ]0, ∞[, c2 ∈ [0, ∞[ such that for all s ∈ R
sΨ(s) ≥ c1 |s|p − c2 .
(Ψ4) There exist c3 , c4 ∈ ]0, ∞[ such that for all s ∈ R
|Ψ(s)| ≤ c3 |s|p−1 + c4 ,
where p is as in (Ψ3).

Remark 3.1. Since here H is not taken as L2 (Λ), by the definition of the Gelfand
triple, one should note that
p
V ∗ 6= L p−1 (Λ).
In fact, one can prove that (see [34, Lemma 4.1.13])
p

V ∗ = ∆(L p−1 (Λ)).
Theorem 3.1. Suppose that Ψ satisfies (Ψ1)–(Ψ4). Then Theorem 2.7 applies
with A := ∆Ψ(·) and α := p.
Proof. Now we can define the porous medium operator A : V → V ∗ by
(3.2)

A(u) := ∆Ψ(u),

u ∈ Lp (Λ).

Note that by [34, Lemma 4.1.13] the operator A is well defined. The conclusion follows
directly from Theorem 2.7 by checking that (H1)–(H4) hold for −A.
In fact, it is well known that the porous medium operator satisfies the monotonicity and coercivity properties (see, e.g., [34, section 4.1]). We include the proof here
for the reader’s convenience.
(H1) Let u, v, x ∈ V = Lp (Λ) and λ ∈ R. Then

by
[c4 + c3 2p−2 (|u|p−1 + |v|p−1 )]|x|,
which by Hölder’s inequality is in L1 (Λ). So, (H1) follows by (Ψ1) and
Lebesgue’s dominated convergence theorem.

A(v) = ∆(v|v|p−2 ), v ∈ Lp (Λ),
which is the nonlinear operator appearing in the classical porous medium equation

whose solution describes the time evolution of the density u(t) of a substance in a
porous medium. And as a matter of fact, the time-fractional porous medium equation
was first introduced by Caputo in [12] to describe the diffusion of fluids in porous
media with memory.
(ii) As mentioned before, our results apply to the situation in [50] where ∆Ψ(u) is
replaced by LΨ(u); here L is the generator of a transient Dirichlet form on L2 (E, E, µ)
for abstract σ-finite measure spaces (E, E, µ), so (2.15) takes the form

Here A is called the p-Laplacian, also denoted by ∆p . Note that ∆2 = ∆.
It is well known that A : V → V ∗ is well defined (see, e.g., [34, section 4.1]). In
fact, we only need to show that the right-hand side of (3.6) defines a linear functional
in v ∈ V which is continuous with respect to k kV = k k1,p . First we recall that

Theorem 3.2. Suppose that p ≥ 2. Then Theorem 2.7 applies with A as defined
in (3.5) and α := p.
Proof. The conclusion follows directly from Theorem 2.7 by checking that (H1)–
(H4) hold for −A here. Now we include the proof here also for the reader’s convenience.
(H1) Let u, v, x ∈ H01,p (Λ); then by (3.6) we have to show for λ ∈ R, |λ| ≤ 1

Since obviously the integrands converge to zero as λ → 0 dξ-a.e., we only have
to find a dominating function to apply Lebesgue’s dominated convergence
theorem. But obviously, since |λ| ≤ 1,
|∇(u + λv)(ξ)|p−2 |h∇(u + λv)(ξ), ∇x(ξ)i|

≤2p−2 |∇u(ξ)|p−1 + |∇v(ξ)|p−1 |∇x(ξ)|,
and the right-hand side is in L1 (Λ) by Hölder’s inequality as we have seen
above.
(H2) Let u, v ∈ H01,p (Λ). Then by (3.6)

since the map R+ 3 s 7→ sp−1 is increasing. Hence (H2) is proved.

So, (H3) holds with α = p.
(H4) This condition holds for A by (3.7) with α = p.
Remark 3.3. (i) It is easy to show that the above result also holds for the more
general case where ∆p is replaced by
A(u) := div (Ψ(|∇X(t)|)∇X(t)) ,
where Ψ satisfies (Ψ1)–(Ψ4) with some p > 1. Moreover, one can further generalize
to the more general quasi-linear differential operator
X
A(u) :=
(−1)|i| Di Ai (t, x, Du(t, x)), where Du = (Dj u)|j|≤m .
|i|≤m

Under certain assumptions the above operator also satisfies (H1)–(H4) (cf., e.g., [63,
Proposition 30.10]).

QUASI-LINEAR SPDE WITH TIME-FRACTIONAL DERIVATIVES

(ii) In the case of the p-Laplacian or more general operators, it is possible to add
some monomials up to order p as perturbation. For example, since H01,p (Λ) ⊂ Lp (Λ)
is continuous and dense,
A(u) := div(|∇u|p−2 ∇u) − u|u|p−2 , u ∈ H01,p (Λ),
still satisfies (H1)–(H4) with respect to the Gelfand triple
H01,p (Λ) ⊂ L2 (Λ) ⊂ (H01,p (Λ))∗ .
