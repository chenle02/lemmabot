On the Optimal Filtering of Diffusion Processes
MOSH:E ZAKAI

Received November 1, 1967
Summary. Let x(t) be a diffusion process satisfying a stochastic differential equation and
let the observed process y(t) be related to x(t) by dy(t) = g(x(t)) + dw(t) where w(t) is a
Brownian motion. The problem considered is that of finding the conditional probability of
x(t) conditioned on the observed path y(s), 0 <~ s <~ t. Results on the gadon-Nikodym
derivative of measures induced by diffusions processes are applied to derive equations which
determine the required conditional probabilities.
1. Introduction

Let xt satisfy the stochastic differential equation dxt = a ( x t ) d t + b ( x t ) d ( v t
where wt is a Brownian motion, and let Yt be related to xt b y dyt = g (xt)dt + dwt,
where wt is a Brownian motion independent of wt (conditions on a (x), b (x)and
g (x) will be imposed in the next section). The xt process can be considered as the
motion of a noise-perturbed dynamical system and Yt as a noisy observation
on xt. This suggests the problem of determining the conditional probability of xt,
conditioned on the observed path ys, 0 ~ s ~_ t. This problem was considered
b y STRATONOVICH[1], K v s ~ g
[2], BvcY [3], SgmYA~V [4] and others. 1
Previous work on this problem concentrated mainly on finding equations
satisfied b y p (u, y~), the conditional density of xt given the observed path Ys,
0 <-- s <~ t, (assuming it exists) and the derivations were formal. Recently K v s ~ N ] ~
proved t h a t conditional expectations of functions of xt satisfy (under certain
restrictions) a stochastic equation [2].
Let r (u, y~) be related to p (u, y~) b y
p (u, yto) = q) (u, yto). (~ q5 (u, yto) d u ) - l ,
Ev
the results of this paper deal with the unnormalized density ~b (u, yt). I t turns out
t h a t this leads to considerably simpler equations as compared to the equations
for p(u, y~). The results of this paper are based on results of S~:OgOHOD and
GI~SA~OV for the Radon-Nikodym derivaties of measures induced b y solutions
of stochastic differential equations. Two stochastic equations for ~5 (u, y~) are
derived. The first equation is derived in section 3 (theorem 1 and corollary 1).
1 After this paper was written we learned of the work of R. E. IV[ORT]~=~SE~(University
of California, Berkeley, Elektronics Research Laboratory Report EgL-66-1, August 1966),
and T. E. DvNCA~r (Stanford University, Center for Systems Research, Technical Report
7001-4, May 1967), which contain results similar to some of the results of this paper. In
particular, 1VIo~T~S~ derived, under some additional restrictions, the results of corollary I
and DvNeA~ obtained, formally, the results of theorem 3. We wish to thank T. K).ILA~rEfor
calling our attention to these references.

The uniqueness of the solution to this equation is considered in section 4. The
second equation is derived in section 5. The assumptions of theorem 3 (section 5)
include some smoothness properties of the solution to equation (18). Conditions
under which the solution has these properties are unknown at present. A similar
remark applies to theorem 4 (section 5). I t will be obvious from the proofs that
it is possible to trade assumptions on the transition density of the xt process for
assumptions on the solution to Eq. (18) [or Eq. (30)]. The results of section 5
should therefore be considered to be of exploratory nature.

2. Some General Relations
Let (Q, d ) be a measurable space and /~0, #1, two equivalent probability
measures on (f2, ~4). Let

A (co) = ~ - ~ (co)
be the Radon-Nikodym derivative of #1 with respect to r Let X (co) be a random
variable on (D, d ) and let the expectation of I X (x) I with respect to #1 be finite.
Let ~ be a sub a-field of ~ and E(0)(E(1)) denote expectations and conditional
expectation with respect to/~0 (#1). Then, a.s. #1 and/to, ([5], section 24.4):
E(1) (X (co) ] ~ ) = E(0)(X (o)) A (~o)l ~)

Let h (x) stand for g (x) or any of the entries of a (x) and b (x), we assume that
h (x) satisfies the Lipschitz condition

The initial condition for the xt process, x0, will be assumed to be a random variable

where x~ (y0~) stands for the path xs (Ys), 0 ~ 8 ~ T. Since/~1 and/t0 are equivalent,
any a.s. property with respect to one measure is also a.s. with respect to the other
measure. From here on all equalities between conditional expectations and conditional probabilities are to be understood in the a.s. sense, even when this is not
stated explicitly. Also, all the a-fields considered will be assumed to be complete
with respect to the involved measures (the Lebesgue measure on Er and [0, T],
and/to).
Let 2Y(xt, y~)) denote the sub a-field induced by the family of random variables
xt, Yo, 0 ~-- 0 ~-- s (similarly, we will use ~ ( x s , xt, y~)), ~(y~)) etc.). Let ](x) be a
reM valued, bounded Borel function of x (x e Er ;) then, by (1) and the smoothing
property for conditional expectations we have:

E (1) (/(xt)l~ (Yto)) ~ E{0)(E(0)(A(Z~o,y~) [g (xt, y~)) / (xt} l g (y*o)}
E~o>{E(0)(A(x~o,y~o)l~(xt, y~))]2(y~)}

Let A(u, y~) be the value of some version of E(0)(A (x~, yg)[ ~ (xt, yto)) at xt = u
and the path y~. Let
P (u, t) = Prob {xt ~ u},
u e Er
(6)
(where xt ~= u means that each component of xt satisfies the inequality with
respect to the corresponding component of u). Since, under/to, 2Y(y~) and 2Y(x~)
are independent, it follows by Fubini's theorem that:

E(o){E(o)(A(xto, yto)l~(xt,Y~o))/(xt)l~(yto) } = .~/(u),4(u, Yto)P(du, t)

where F is any Betel set in Er. Furthermore, the conditional probability obtained
by (9) is a conditional probability distribution ofxt relative to ~ (y~) ([8], Ch. I, w9).
In particular, if P (u, t) is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue
measure and P(du, t ) = p(u, t)du then a version of Prob{xt ~ F I 2 ( y ~ ) } is also
absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure and the density

In view of Eqs. (9) and (10), the problem of finding the conditional probability
of xt conditioned on yt0 (with respect to the measure induced by Eq. (2)) has been
transformed to the problem of finding E(o)(A (xto, yto)]2(xt, yto)) where the conditional expectation is with respect to the measure induced by (3) and A (x~, yt)
is given by (4). The numerators of (9) and (10) will be called the unnormalized conditional probability and density, respectively. Equations for expectations of
multiplieative fnnetionals of Markov processes, including expectations of the form
E (A (x~, y~)] ~ (xt)) (and E(0) (A (xt, yt)] 2 (xt, yto)) with Yt differentiable) were
derived by Kac, Fortet and others [9]. These results, though not applicable to the
present case, motivated Che results of sections 3 and 5.
3. An Integral Equation for the Unnormalized Conditional Probability
Theorem 1. For the (xt, yt) process defined by Eq. (2), P (xt ~ / ' ] ~(y~)) satis/ies
Eq. (9) and A(u, yto) satis/ies a.s. the equation

It will be proved later (starting with Eq. (19)) that (13a) implies that:

Let t >--s > 0 and ~1 = ~ (x~, y~), ~2 -----~ (Y~-- Ys, s < ~ ~ t) and ~ -- ~ (xt, y~).
Since, under it0, ~(x~) is independent of 2 ( y t) and ~ is a Brownian motion, it
follows that ~1 and ~2 are conditionally independent given ~ ([5], 25.3A p. 351).
Applying again theorem 25.3A of [5] (with subscripts 1 and 2 interchanged) it
follows that for any B e x o, YoJ.
P (B[ 2(xt, y~) = P (B[2(xt, y~)).
By [8] (theorem 8.4 chapter I) and by the smoothing property of conditional
expectations:

~(0) {A (x$, y~) ~ (x~)I~ (x~, y~)} = E(0) {A (zb y~)g (x~)[~ (x. yg)}
= E(0) {E(0) (A (xg, y~)[ ~ (xs, xt, y~)) g (xs)] 2 (xt, yg)}.
By the Markov property of (Xs, ys), ~ (xg, y~) and ~ (xt) are conditionally indepen-

gO) and ~(xt) are also conditionally independent given ~(xs, y~). Applying again 25.3A of [5] with interchanged subscripts) we have from the last equation,

K(o){A

}.

(15)

By the same argument as used for Eq. (7), the right hand side of (15) is given by
([8], chapter I, theorem 9.5):

f g(z) zl(z, y~) P (dz, s; u, t)

(16)

where P(dz, s; u, t) is defined by Eq. (12). Eq. (11) follows now by substituting
(16) and (15) into (14).
Corollary 1. I/the transition probability Prob {xt ~ F I xs = z}, s < t, is absolutely
continuous with respect to the Lebesgue meazure with the density pz(u, t -- s), then a
version o] Prob {xt e 1~I ~(y~)}, t > O, is also absolutely continuous with respect to
the Lebesgue measure. This density, p(u, t l~(yto)), satis[ies

Proo]. Since
Er

where F (z) is the probability distribution of x0, it follows that for t > 0 Prob {xt e F}
is also absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure with density
p(u, t). By Eq. (1O), we set: r
t ) = A(u,y~o)p(u, t). Since xt is a Markov
process p(u,t)P(dz, s;u,t)--=p(z,s)pz(u,t--s)dz. Therefore, multiplying Eq. (11)
by p(u, t), (18) follows. Following the same arguments as used to derive (11), it
also follows that
t

fi (u, y~) -= ] A(z, y~) P (dz, s; u, t) dz + ~ f g (z) A(z, y~)P (dz, U; u, t) dy v ,

multiplying this equation by p(u, t) gives (18a).

A (x~, y~) and ~ (s) for ~ (xs, y~)).
Let us first assume that [g(x)[ is bounded. I t follows, then, from theorem 7.3

A(8)g(xs) is continuous in quadratic mean. Therefore, there exists a sequence of

Let H be the class of real valued functions ~(u, t, co) on Er • [0, T] • Y2

(27)

for t > 0 and Uo/(u) =/(u). In this section we will assume that Ut is a bounded
transformation from L2 functions on Er to L2 functions on Er, uniformly in [0, T].
Namely, there exists a constant k < co such that

I t follows from A.2, by the mean value theorem for derivatives and ITd's dominated convergence lemma ([12] p. 14 or [3] chapter 2 section I) that, in the right

Since under our assumptions ~ (0, 7) is a.s. a bounded function of 0, 7 in ~ e Is, 0],
0 e Is, t], it follows that I~v converges in probability to zero. Therefore, (35a)
and (35) holds a.s. Note that the strong assumptions in theorem 3 were mainly
needed for the justification of the interchange of ~+ with the stochastic integration
in the right hand side of (35) (the proof of (35 a) can be modified to hold under
weaker assumptions).
