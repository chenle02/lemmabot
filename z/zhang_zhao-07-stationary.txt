Abstract
In this paper we study the existence of stationary solutions for stochastic partial differential equations.
We establish a new connection between L2ρ (Rd ; R1 ) ⊗ L2ρ (Rd ; Rd ) valued solutions of backward doubly
stochastic differential equations (BDSDEs) on infinite horizon and the stationary solutions of the SPDEs.
Moreover, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of BDSDEs on both finite and infinite
horizons, so obtain the solutions of initial value problems and the stationary solutions (independent of any
initial value) of SPDEs. The connection of the weak solutions of SPDEs and BDSDEs has independent
interests in the areas of both SPDEs and BSDEs.

This “one-force, one-solution” setting is a natural extension of equilibria or fixed points in
deterministic systems to stochastic counterparts. The simplest nontrivial example is the Ornstein–
Uhlenbeck process defined by the stochastic differential
 t equation du(t) = −u(t) dt + dBt . It
defines a random dynamical system u(t, u0 ) = u0 e−t + 0 e−(t−s) dBs and its stationary point is
0
given by Y (ω) = −∞ es dBs . Moreover, for any u0 , u(t, u0 , θ−t ω) → Y (ω) as t → ∞, where θt
is the shift operator of the Brownian path: (θt B)(s) = B(t + s) − B(s) for any s ∈ (−∞, +∞).
A pathwise stationary solution describes the pathwise invariance of the stationary solution over
time along the measurable and P -preserving transformation θt : Ω → Ω, and the pathwise limit
of the solutions of random dynamical systems. Needless to say, it is one of the fundamental
questions of basic importance [1,7,14,21,29,30]. For random dynamical systems generated by
stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), such random fixed points consist of infinitely
many random moving invariant surfaces on the configuration space due to the random external
force pumped to the system constantly. They are more realistic models than many deterministic models as it demonstrates some complicated phenomena such as turbulence. Their existence
and stability are of great interests in both mathematics and physics. However, in contrast to the
deterministic dynamical systems, also due to the fact that the external random force exists at all
time, the existence of stationary solutions of stochastic dynamical systems generated e.g. by stochastic differential equations (SDEs) or SPDEs, is a difficult and subtle problem. We would like
to point out that there have been extensive works on stability and invariant manifolds of random
dynamical systems, and researchers usually assume there is an invariant set (or a single point:
a stationary solution or a fixed point, often assumed to be 0), then prove invariant manifolds and
stability results at a point of the invariant set (Arnold [1] and references therein, Ruelle [28],
Duan, Lu and Schaumulfuss [10,11], Li and Lu [19], Mohammed, Zhang and Zhao [21] to name
but a few). But the invariant manifolds theory gives neither the existence results of the invariant
set and the stationary solution nor a way to find them. In particular, for the existence of stationary
solutions for SPDEs, results are only known in very few cases [7,14,21,29,30]. In [29,30], the
stationary strong solution of the stochastic Burgers’ equations with periodic or random forcing
(C 3 in the space variable) was established by Sinai using the Hopf–Cole transformation. In [21],
the stationary solution of the stochastic evolution equations was identified as a solution of the
corresponding integral equation up to time +∞ and the existence was established for certain
SPDEs by Mohammed, Zhang and Zhao. But the existence of solutions of such a stochastic
integral equations in general is far from clear.
The main purpose of this paper is to find the pathwise stationary solution of the following

with (aij (x)) = σ σ ∗ (x). Equation (1.2) is very general, especially the nonlinear functions f
and g can include ∇u and the second order differential operator L is allowed to be degenerate,
while in most literature, g is not allowed to depend on ∇u or g only depends on ∇u linearly
(Da Prato and Zabczyk [8], Krylov [16], Pardoux [23]). As an intermediate step, the result of
existence and uniqueness of the weak solutions of (1.2), obtained by solving the corresponding
backward doubly stochastic differential equations (BDSDEs), appears also new. The existence
and uniqueness of such equations when g is independent of ∇u or linearly dependent of ∇u were
studied by Da Prato and Zabczyk [8], Krylov [16]. But we do not claim here our results on the
existence and uniqueness for the types of SPDEs studied in [8,16] have superseded their previous
results.
Note that from the pathwise stationary solution obtained in this paper, we can construct an invariant measure for the skew product of the metric dynamical system and the random dynamical
system. In this connection, we mention that in recent years, substantial results on the existence
and uniqueness of invariant measures for SPDEs and weak convergence of the law of the solutions as time tends to infinity have been proved for many important SPDEs [5,6,9,12,13] to name
but a few). The invariant measure describes the invariance of a certain solution in law when time
changes, therefore it is a stationary measure of the Markov transition probability. It is well known
that an invariant measure gives a stationary solution when it is a random Dirac measure. Although
an invariant measure of a random dynamical system on R1 gives a stationary solution, in general,
this is not true unless one considers an extended probability space. However, considering the extended probability space, one essentially regards the random dynamical system as noise as well,
so the dynamics is different. See [20] for some examples of SDEs on R1 and a perfect cocycle
on S1 having an invariant measure, but not a stationary solution. In fact, the stationary solution
we study in this paper gives the support of the corresponding invariant measure, so reveals more
detailed information than an invariant measure.
In this paper, BDSDEs will be used as our tool to study stationary solutions of SPDEs. We will
prove that the solutions of the corresponding infinite horizon BDSDEs give the desired stationary
solutions of the SPDEs (1.2). Backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) have been
studied extensively in the last 16 years since the pioneering work of Pardoux and Peng [24].
The connection between BSDEs and quasilinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs)
was discovered by Pardoux and Peng in [25] and Peng in [27]. The study of the connection of
weak solutions of PDEs and BSDEs began in Barles and Lesigne [4]. The BDSDEs and their
connections with the SPDEs were studied by Pardoux and Peng in [26] for the strong solutions,
and by Bally and Matoussi in [3] for the weak solutions. On the other hand, the infinite horizon
BSDE was first studied by Peng in [27] and it was shown that the corresponding PDE is a Poisson
equation (elliptic equation). This was studied systematically by Pardoux in [22]. Notice that the
solutions of the Poisson equations can be regarded as the stationary solutions of the parabolic
PDEs. Deepening this idea, it would not be unreasonable to conjecture that the solutions of
infinite horizon BDSDEs (if exists) be the stationary solutions of the corresponding SPDEs. Of
course, we cannot write them as solutions of Poisson equations or stochastic Poisson equations
like in the deterministic cases. However, it is very natural to describe the stationary solutions of
SPDEs by the solutions of infinite horizon BDSDEs. In this sense, BDSDEs (or BSDEs) can be
regarded as more general SPDEs (or PDEs).
As far as we know, the connection of the pathwise stationary solutions of the SPDEs and infinite horizon BDSDEs we study in this paper is new (Section 2). We believe this new method can
be used to many SPDEs such as those with quadratic or polynomial growth nonlinear terms. We
do not intend to include all these results in the present paper, but only study Lipschitz continuous

nonlinear term to initiate this intrinsic method to the study of this basic problem in dynamics of
SPDEs. We would like to point out that our BDSDE method depends on neither the continuity of
the random dynamical system (continuity means u(t, ·, ω) : U → U is a.s. continuous) nor on the
method of the random attractors. The continuity problem for the SPDE (1.2) with the nonlinear
noise considered in this paper still remains open mainly due to the failure of Kolmogorov’s continuity theorem in infinite-dimensional setting as pointed out by some researchers (e.g. [10,21]).
One of the necessary intermediate steps is to study the BDSDEs on finite horizon and establish their connections with the weak solutions of SPDEs (Sections 3 and 4). Our method to
study the L2ρ (Rd ; R1 ) ⊗ L2ρ (Rd ; Rd ) valued solutions of BDSDEs on finite horizon was inspired
by Bally and Matoussi’s approach on the existence and uniqueness of solutions of BDSDEs
with finite-dimensional Brownian motions [3]. But our results are stronger and our conditions
are weaker. We will solve the BDSDEs driven by the cylindrical Brownian motion and nonlinear terms satisfying Lipschitz conditions in the space L2ρ (Rd ; R1 ) ⊗ L2ρ (Rd ; Rd ). We obtain a
unique solution (Y.t,· , Z.t,· ) ∈ S 2,0 ([t, T ]; L2ρ (Rd ; R1 )) ⊗ M 2,0 ([t, T ]; L2ρ (Rd ; Rd )). The result
Y.t,· ∈ S 2,0 ([t, T ]; L2ρ (Rd ; R1 ), which plays an important role in solving the nonlinear BDSDEs
and proving the connection with the weak solutions of SPDEs (also BSDEs and PDEs), was not
obtained in [3]. The generalized equivalence of norm principle (Section 2), which is a simple
extension of the equivalence of norm principle obtained by Kunita [17], Barles and Lesigne [4],
Bally and Matoussi [3] to random functions, also plays an important role in the proofs of our
results. We believe our results for finite time BDSDEs are new even for BSDEs.
In Section 5, we will solve the BDSDEs on infinite horizon and in Section 6, we study continuity of the solution in order to ensure that it gives the perfect stationary solutions of the SPDEs.

Similarly, for 0  t  T < ∞, we define M 2,0 ([t, T ]; S) and S 2,0 ([t, T ]; S) on finite time

Note that the integral with respect to B̂ is a “backward Itô’s integral” and the integral with

(ii) One can easily verify that the above definition does not depend on the choice of H0 due to
the continuity of the inner product.
(iii) The uniqueness of Y in S 2,−K ([0, ∞); H ) implies if (Y  , Z  ) is another solution, then
Ys = Ys for all s  0 a.s. The uniqueness of Z implies Zs = Zs for a.e. s ∈ [0, ∞) a.s. But we
can modify the Z at the measure zero exceptional set of s such that Zs = Zs for all s  0 a.s.
The first main purpose of this section is to study the stationary property of the solution of
BDSDE (2.2) on H if the solution exists and is unique. In order to show the main idea, we first
assume that there exists a unique solution of Eq. (2.2). The study of the existence and uniqueness
of Eq. (2.2) will be deferred to later sections (Sections 3–5).
We now construct the measurable metric dynamical system through defining a measurable
and measure-preserving shift. Let θ̂t : Ω → Ω, t  0, be a measurable mapping on (Ω, F , P ),
defined by θ̂t ◦ B̂s = B̂s+t − B̂t , θ̂t ◦ Ws = Ws+t − Wt . Then for any s, t  0,
(i) P · θ̂t−1 = P ;

(iii) θ̂s ◦ θ̂t = θ̂s+t .
Also for an arbitrary F measurable φ : Ω → H , set

θ̂ ◦ φ(ω) = φ θ̂ (ω) .
We give the following bounded and stationary conditions for f , g with respect to θ̂· :

g(s, Y, Z) = g(s + r, Y, Z).
We start from the following general result about the stationarity of the solution of infinite
horizon BDSDE.
Proposition 2.5. Assume Eq. (2.2) has a unique solution (Y, Z), then under conditions (A.1) and
(A.2), (Yt , Zt )t0 is a “perfect” stationary solution, i.e.
θ̂r ◦ Yt = Yt+r ,

θ̂r ◦ Zt = Zt+r

for all r, t  0 a.s.

Proof. Let Bs = B̂T  −s − B̂T  for arbitrary T  > 0 and −∞ < s  T  . Then Bs is a Brownian
motion with B0 = 0. For any r  0, applying θ̂r on Bs , we have
θ̂r ◦ Bs = θ̂r ◦ (B̂T  −s − B̂T  ) = B̂T  −s+r − B̂T  +r
= (B̂T  −s+r − B̂T  ) − (B̂T  +r − B̂T ) = Bs−r − B−r .

We consider the equivalent form Eq. (2.6) instead of Eq. (2.2). Applying the operator θ̂r on
both sides of Eq. (2.6) and by (2.8), we know that θ̂r ◦ Yt satisfies the following equation:

(2.10)

Let Ŷ· = θ̂r ◦ Y·−r , Ẑ· = θ̂r ◦ Z·−r . By the uniqueness of solution of Eq. (2.6) and Remark 2.4(iii),
it follows from comparing (2.9) with (2.10) that for any r  0,
θ̂r ◦ Yt = Ŷt+r = Yt+r ,

θ̂r ◦ Zt = Ẑt+r = Zt+r

for all t  0 a.s.

Then by perfection procedure [1,2], we can prove above identities are true for all t, r  0 a.s. We

An important application of the BDSDEs is to connect its solution with the solution of the
corresponding SPDEs. If some kind of relationship is established, we can transfer stationary
solutions from the infinite horizon BDSDEs to SPDEs. In this way, we are in access to stationary
solutions of the SPDEs due to the stationary property of solutions of infinite horizon BDSDEs.
For this, a specific Hilbert space H = L2ρ (Rd ; R1 ) defined below is considered. The main aim of
rest of this section is to construct the stationary solution of the SPDEs. Some proofs are given in
this sections. But many detailed proofs are postponed to later sections.

We can write down the solution spaces following Definition 2.1: M 2,−K ([0, ∞); L2ρ (Rd ; R1 )),
M 2,−K ([0, ∞); L2ρ (Rd ; Rd )) and S 2,−K ([0, ∞); L2ρ (Rd ; R1 )). Similar to the definition for
p
M 2,−K ([0, ∞); L2ρ (Rd ; Rd )), we can also define M p,−K ([0, ∞); Lρ (Rd ; Rd )).
k (Rp , Rq ) the set of C k -functions whose partial derivatives of
For k  0, we denote by Cl,b
order less than or equal to k are bounded and by Hρk (Rd ; R1 ) the ρ-weighted Sobolev space (see
e.g. [3]). In order to connect BDSDEs with SPDEs, the form of BDSDEs should be a kind of
FBDSDEs (forward and backward doubly SDEs). So we first give the following forward SDE.

Moreover, it is well known that the solution defines a stochastic flow of diffeomorphism
Xst,· : Rd → Rd and denote by X̂st,· the inverse flow (see e.g. Kunita [17]). Denote by J (X̂st,x )
the determinant of the Jacobi matrix of X̂st,x . For ϕ ∈ Hρk (Rd ; R1 ), we define a process ϕt : Ω ×
[0, T ] × Rd → R1 by ϕt (s, x) = ϕ(X̂st,x )J (X̂st,x ). It is proved in [3] that ϕt (s, ·) ∈ Hρk (Rd ; R1 )

Remark 2.9. We need monotone condition (A.4) in order to solve the infinite horizon BDSDEs.
But it does not seem obvious to replace the Lipschitz condition for f in (A.1) by a weaker
condition on f such as f is continuous in y using the infinite horizon BSDE procedure (e.g. [22]).
The difficulty is due to the fact that we consider various conditions in the space L2ρ (Rd ; R1 ) here
rather than pointwise ones, therefore we cannot solve the BDSDEs pointwise in x. However,
our conjecture is that the Lipschitz condition can be relaxed if we strengthen some conditions
in L2ρ (Rd ; R1 ) to pointwise ones. We will study this generality in future publications. Here due
to the length of the paper, we only consider the Lipschitz continuous function f to initiate this
intrinsic method to the study of this basic problem.
We first acknowledge the two theorems below and give their proofs in Section 6.

Theorem 2.11. Under conditions (A.1) –(A.4) , let u(t, ·)  Ytt,· , where (Y·t,· , Z·t,· ) is the solution
of Eq. (2.13). Then for t ∈ [0, T ], u(t, ·) is a weak solution for Eq. (2.16). Moreover, u(t, ·) is a.s.
continuous with respect to t in L2ρ (Rd ; R1 ).
Then we prove the main theorem in this section.
Theorem 2.12. Under conditions (A.1) –(A.4) , let u(t, ·)  Ytt,· , where (Y·t,· , Z·t,· ) is the solution of Eq. (2.13). Then u(t, ·) has an indistinguishable version which is a “perfect” stationary

We take f˜(T ) = ( Rd |f (Xst,x , 0, 0)|2 ρ −1 (x) dx) 2 , then fˆ(T , Y, Z) satisfies condition (A.1).
Similarly we can also prove ĝ(T , Y, Z) satisfies condition (A.1). On the other hand, applying θ̂r
on fˆ(T , Y, Z), by (2.12), we have for any Y ∈ L2ρ (Rd ; R1 ) and Z ∈ L2ρ (Rd ; Rd ),

θ̂r ◦ fˆ(T , Y, Z) = f θ̂r ◦ Xst,· , Y, Z = f Xs+r

Verifying ĝ(T , Y, Z) in the same way, we know that fˆ(T , Y, Z) and ĝ(T , Y, Z) satisfy condition
(A.2). Since by Theorem 2.10, Eq. (2.13) has a unique solution (YT , ZT ), this (YT , ZT ) is a
stationary solution as a consequence of Proposition 2.5. That is to say for any t  0

In particular, for any t  0

θ̂r ◦ Ytt,· = Yt+r

for all r  0 a.s.

(2.18)

By Theorem 2.11, we know that u(t, ·)  Ytt,· is the weak solution for Eq. (2.16), so we get from
(2.18) that for any t  0
θ̂r ◦ u(t, ·) = u(t + r, ·) for all r  0 a.s.
Until now, we know “crude” stationary property for u(t, ·). And by Theorem 2.11, u(t, ·) is
continuous with respect to t, So we can get an indistinguishable version of u(t, ·), still denoted
by u(t, ·), such that
θ̂r ◦ u(t, ·) = u(t + r, ·)

for all t, r  0 a.s.

So we proved the desired result.

By Definition 2.8, conditions (A.1) and (A.2) , one can calculate that g(·, u(s, ·),

(σ ∗ ∇u)(s, ·)) ∈ L2U0 (L2ρ (Rd ; R1 )) is locally square integrable in [0, T ]. Now we consider
Eq. (1.2) with cylindrical Brownian motion B on U0 . For arbitrary T > 0, let Y be the solution of Eq. (2.13) and u(t, ·) = Ytt,· be the stationary solution of Eq. (2.16) with B̂ chosen as
the time reversal of B from time T , i.e. B̂s = BT −s − BT or β̂j (s) = βj (T − s) − βj (T ) for
s  0. By (2.3) and integral transformation in Eq. (2.16), we can see that v(t, x)  u(T − t, x)
satisfies (1.2) or its equivalent form

(θ̂T −t ω̂)(s) = ω̂(T − t + s) − ω̂(T − t)
= (BT −(T −t+s) − BT ) − (BT −(T −t) − BT )
= Bt−s − Bt .
Note that the right-hand side of the above formula does not depend on T , therefore θ̂T −t ω̂(s) =
θ̂T  −t ω̂ (s) = Bt−s − Bt .
On probability space (Ω, F , P ), we define θt = (θ̂t )−1 , t  0. Actually B̂ is a two-sided
Brownian motion, so (θ̂t )−1 = θ̂−t is well defined (see [1]). It is easy to see that θt is a shift with
respect to B satisfying:
(i) P · (θt )−1 = P ;
(ii) θ0 = I ;

3. Finite horizon BDSDEs
Before we study the BDSDEs on infinite horizon, we need to study the BDSDEs on finite horizon and establish the connection with SPDEs. For finite-dimensional noise and under Lipschitz
condition for a.e. x ∈ Rd , the problem was studied in Bally and Matoussi [3]. In this section, we
consider the following BDSDE with infinite-dimensional noise on finite horizon:

Needless to say, the conditions (H.1)–(H.4) for the existence and uniqueness of solution of
Eq. (3.1) are weaker than what are needed for the case of infinite horizon. We would like to
point out that for the finite horizon problem, our conditions are weaker than those in Bally and
Matoussi [3]. In (H.1), we allow the terminal function h depending on Ft,T independent sigma
field FTB̂,∞ . One can easily verify that it does not affect the results in [3]. Moreover, here we only
need Lipschitz condition in the space L2ρ (Rd ; R1 ) instead of the pathwise Lipschitz condition
posed in [3].
Definition 3.1. A pair of processes (Y·t,· , Z·t,· ) ∈ S 2,0 ([0, T ]; L2ρ (Rd ; R1 )) ⊗ M 2,0 ([0, T ];
L2ρ (Rd ; Rd )) is called a solution of Eq. (3.1) if for any ϕ ∈ Cc0 (Rd ; R1 ),

The main objective of this section is to prove
Theorem 3.2. Under conditions (H.1)–(H.4), Eq. (3.1) has a unique solution.
This theorem is an extension of Theorem 3.1 in [3]. The idea is to start from Bally and Matoussi’s results for finite-dimensional noise and then take limit to obtain the solution for the case
of infinite-dimensional noise. But Bally and Matoussi’s results cannot apply immediately here as
we have a weaker Lipschitz condition and some of the key claims in the proof of Theorem 3.1
[3] are not obvious under their conditions. Moreover, the result Y·t,· ∈ S 2,0 ([0, T ]; L2ρ (Rd ; R1 ))
was not obtained in [3]. We study a sequence of BDSDEs

A solution of (3.3) is a pair of processes (Y·t,·,n , Z·t,·,n ) ∈ S 2,0 ([0, T ]; L2ρ (Rd ; R1 ))⊗M 2,0 ([0, T ];
L2ρ (Rd ; Rd )) satisfying the spatial integral form of Eq. (3.3), i.e. (3.2) with a finite number of
one-dimensional backward stochastic integrals.
First we do some preparations.
Lemma 3.3. Under conditions (H.1)–(H.4), if there exists (Y· (·), Z· (·)) ∈ M 2,0 ([t, T ];
L2ρ (Rd ; R1 )) ⊗ M 2,0 ([t, T ]; L2ρ (Rd ; Rd )) satisfying the spatial integral form of Eq. (3.3) for
t  s  T , then Y· (·) ∈ S 2,0 ([t, T ]; L2ρ (Rd ; R1 )) and therefore (Ys (x), Zs (x)) is a solution of
Eq. (3.3).
Proof. Let us first see Ys (·) is continuous with respect to s in L2ρ (Rd ; R1 ). Since (Ys (x), Zs (x))
satisfies the form of Eq. (3.3) for t  s < T , a.e. x ∈ Rd , therefore,

All the terms on the left-hand side of (3.7) are positive when taking K sufficiently large, so it is

the rational number space and noting Rd eKs |Ȳst,x,n |2 ρ −1 (x) dx is continuous with respect to s,
we have Ȳst,x,n = 0 for all s ∈ [t, T ], a.e. x ∈ Rd a.s. Also by (3.7), for a.e. s ∈ [t, T ], Z̄st,x,n = 0
a.e. x ∈ Rd , a.s. We can modify the values of Z at the measure zero exceptional set of s such that

By Lemma 3.3, Ỹ·t,·,n ∈ S 2,0 ([t, T ]; L2ρ (Rd ; R1 )). Then Step 1 follows.
Step 2. Given (Yst,x,n,N −1 , Zst,x,n,N −1 ) ∈ S 2,0 ([t, T ]; L2ρ (Rd ; R1 )) ⊗ M 2,0 ([t, T ]; L2ρ (Rd ; Rd )),

Let (Yrt,x,n,0 , Zrt,x,n,0 ) = (0, 0). By conditions (H.1), (H.3), (H.4) and Lemma 2.6, we know
h, f (r, Xrt,x , 0, 0) and gj (r, Xrt,x , 0, 0) satisfy the conditions in Step 1, so Eq. (3.8) has a
unique solution (Y·t,·,n,1 , Z·t,·,n,1 ) ∈ M 2,0 ([t, T ]; L2ρ (Rd ; R1 )) ⊗ M 2,0 ([t, T ]; L2ρ (Rd ; Rd )) when
f˜(r, Xrt,x ) = f (r, Xrt,x , 0, 0) and g̃(r, Xrt,x ) = g(r, Xrt,x , 0, 0). From Proposition 3.4 and the Fur,X t,x ,n,1

4. Weak solutions of the corresponding SPDEs
In Section 3, we proved the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution of BDSDE (3.1).
We obtained the solution (Yst,x , Zst,x ) by taking the limit of (Yst,x,n , Zst,x,n ) of the solutions of
Eq. (3.3) in the space S 2,0 ([0, T ]; L2ρ (Rd ; R1 )) ⊗ M 2,0 ([0, T ]; L2ρ (Rd ; Rd )). We still start from

Eq. (3.3) in this section. A direct application of Proposition 3.4 and Fubini theorem immediately
leads to
Proposition 4.1. Under conditions (H.1)–(H.4), if we define un (t, x) = Ytt,x,n , v n (t, x) = Ztt,x,n ,
then un (s, Xst,x ) = Yst,x,n , v n (s, Xst,x ) = Zst,x,n for a.e. s ∈ [t, T ], x ∈ Rd a.s.
We first use the idea of Bally and Matoussi [3] to give the correspondence between the
weak solutions of SPDEs and BDSDEs with finite-dimensional noise. Consider the BDSDEs

We define H to be the set of random fields {w(s, x); s ∈ [0, T ], x ∈ Rd } such that (w, σ ∗ ∇w) ∈
T 
M 2,0 ([0, T ]; L2ρ (Rd ; R1 )) ⊗ M 2,0 ([0, T ]; L2ρ (Rd ; Rd )) with the norm (E[ 0 Rd (|w(s, x)|2 +
1

|(σ ∗ ∇)w(s, x)|2 )ρ −1 (x) dx ds) 2 . Following a standard argument as in the proof of the completeness of the Sobolev spaces, we can prove H is complete. Now by the generalized equivalence of norm principle and (4.2), we can see that ũnm is a Cauchy sequence in H. So
there exists ũn ∈ H such that (ũnm , σ ∗ ∇ ũnm ) → (ũn , σ ∗ ∇ ũn ) in M 2,0 ([0, T ]; L2ρ (Rd ; R1 )) ⊗
M 2,0 ([0, T ]; L2ρ (Rd ; Rd )). Moreover Ỹst,x,n = ũn (s, Xst,x ), Z̃st,x,n = σ ∗ ∇ ũn (s, Xst,x ) for a.e.
s ∈ [t, T ], x ∈ Rd a.s. Now it is easy to pass the limit as m → ∞ in (4.1) to conclude that
ũn is a weak solution of the corresponding SPDEs. For the nonlinear case, we can regard
f˜(r, x) = f (r, x, ũn (r, x), σ ∗ ∇ ũn (r, x)), g̃j (r, x) = gj (r, x, ũn (r, x), σ ∗ ∇ ũn (r, x)), and f˜, g̃j
satisfy the conditions in the above argument. If we define un (t, x) = Ytt,x,n and v n (t, x) = Ztt,x,n ,
using a similar proof as in the proof of Theorem 3.1 in [3] together with Theorem 3.5 and
Proposition 4.1, we have, under conditions (H.1)–(H.4), v n (t, x) = (σ ∗ ∇un )(t, x). Moreover,
(un , σ ∗ ∇un ) ∈ M 2,0 ([0, T ]; L2ρ (Rd ; R1 )) ⊗ M 2,0 ([0, T ]; L2ρ (Rd ; Rd )), un (t, x) is the weak solution of the following SPDE:

In this section, we study Eq. (2.16) with f and g allowed to depend on time as discussed in
Section 3 and this section. By intuition if we define u(t, x) = Ytt,x , it should be a “weak solution”
of the Eq. (2.16) with u(T , x) = h(x). We will prove this result.
First we need some necessary preparations.
Proposition 4.2. Under conditions (H.1)–(H.4), let (Yst,x , Zst,x ) be the solution of Eq. (3.1). If
we define u(t, x) = Ytt,x , then σ ∗ ∇u(t, x) exists for a.e. t ∈ [0, T ], x ∈ Rd a.s., and u(s, Xst,x ) =
Yst,x , (σ ∗ ∇u)(s, Xst,x ) = Zst,x for a.e. s ∈ [t, T ], x ∈ Rd a.s.
Proof. First we prove un is a Cauchy sequence in H. For this, by Lemma 2.6 and Proposition 4.1,
as m, n → ∞, we have

We define u(t, x) = Ytt,x , then similar to the proof as in Proposition 4.1, by the uniqueness of

Theorem 4.3. Under conditions (H.1)–(H.4), if we define u(t, x) = Ytt,x , where (Yst,x , Zst,x ) is the
solution of Eq. (3.1), then u(t, x) is the unique weak solution of Eq. (2.16) with u(T , x) = h(x).
Moreover, u(s, Xst,x ) = Yst,x , (σ ∗ ∇u)(s, Xst,x ) = Zst,x for a.e. s ∈ [t, T ], x ∈ Rd a.s.
Proof. From Proposition 4.2, we only need to verify that this u is the unique weak solution of

It is obvious that the first term tends to zero as n → ∞. The last two terms can be treated using
a similar method as (3.17) and (3.18).
Therefore u(t, x) satisfies (2.17), so is a weak solution of Eq. (2.16) with u(T , x) = h(x).
The uniqueness can be proved following a similar argument of Theorem 3.1 in Bally and Matoussi [3]. 2

The main objective of this section is to prove
Theorem 5.1. Under conditions (H.4)–(H.7), Eq. (5.1) has a unique solution.
Proof. Uniqueness. Let (Yst,x , Zst,x ) and (Ŷst,x , Ẑst,x ) be two solutions of Eq. (5.1). Define
Ȳst,x = Ŷst,x − Yst,x ,
Z̄st,x = Ẑst,x − Zst,x ,

Then the uniqueness is proved.
Existence. For each n ∈ N, we define a sequence of BDSDEs (3.1) with h = 0 and T = n
and denote it by Eq. (3.1n ). It is easy to verify that for each n, these BDSDEs satisfy conditions
of Theorem 3.2. Therefore, for each n, there exists a (Yst,x,n , Zst,x,n ) ∈ S 2,0 ([0, n]; L2ρ (Rd ; R1 ))⊗
M 2,0 ([0, n]; L2ρ (Rd ; Rd )) which is equivalent to the space S 2,−K ([0, n]; L2ρ (Rd ; R1 )) ⊗
M 2,−K ([0, n]; L2ρ (Rd ; Rd )) and (Yst,x,n , Zst,x,n ) is the unique solution of Eq. (3.1n ). That is

Let (Ytn , Ztn )t>n = (0, 0), then (Yst,x,n , Zst,x,n ) ∈ S 2,−K ∩ M 2,−K ([0, ∞); L2ρ (Rd ; R1 )) ⊗ M 2,−K
([0, ∞); L2ρ (Rd ; Rd )). We will prove (Yst,x,n , Zst,x,n ) is a Cauchy sequence. For this, let
(Yst,x,m , Zst,x,m ) and (Yst,x,n , Zst,x,n ) be the solutions of Eqs. (3.1m ) and (3.1n ), respectively.
Without losing any generality, assume that m  n, and define

Consider two cases:
(i) When n  s  m, Ȳst,x,m,n = Yst,x,m . Since (Yst,x,m , Zst,x,m ) is the solution of Eq. (3.1m ),

E[ Rd |YTT ,x |2 ρ −1 (x) dx] < ∞. It follows that condition (H.1) is satisfied. Moreover, conditions
