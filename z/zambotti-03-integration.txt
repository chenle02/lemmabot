We study a white-noise driven semilinear partial differential equation
on the spatial interval [0, 1] with Dirichlet boundary condition and with a
singular drift of the form cu−3 , c > 0. We prove existence and uniqueness
of a non-negative continuous adapted solution u on [0, ∞) × [0, 1] for every
nonnegative continuous initial datum x, satisfying x(0) = x(1) = 0. We prove
that the law πδ of the Bessel bridge on [0, 1] of dimension δ > 3 is the unique
invariant probability measure of the process x → u, with c = (δ − 1)(δ − 3)/8
and, if δ ∈ N, that u is the radial part in the sense of Dirichlet forms of the
Rδ -valued solution of a linear stochastic heat equation. An explicit integration
by parts formula w.r.t. πδ is given for all δ > 3.

1. Introduction. We are concerned with the following white-noise driven
stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) on the spatial interval [0, 1]:

where x : [0, 1] → [0, ∞) is continuous and satisfies x(0) = x(1) = 0, W is a
Brownian sheet and δ > 3.
In this paper we prove first that, for all δ > 3, there exists a unique continuous
nonnegative solution uδ of (1) on [0, ∞) × [0, 1] such that (uδ )−3 ∈ L1loc ([0, ∞)
× (0, 1)), and that uδ is adapted. Notice that the nonlinearity in (1) is singular
enough to make the standard techniques noneffective.
Secondly, we study the ergodicity of the solution of (1): we prove that the
process x → uδ is symmetric w.r.t. the law πδ of the δ-dimensional Bessel bridge
on [0, 1] and that πδ is the unique invariant probability measure of x → uδ .
One of the main tools is the following integration by parts formula w.r.t. the
probability measure πδ , δ > 3:

where ϕ : L2 (0, 1) → R is Fréchet differentiable with bounded gradient,
h : [0, 1] → R is twice continuously differentiable with compact support in (0, 1)
and h is the second derivative of h, ∂h ϕ is the directional derivative of ϕ along
h ∈ L2 (0, 1) and ·, · is the canonical scalar product in L2 (0, 1). This result allows
us to prove that x → uδ is a gradient system, that is, it is the diffusion associated

[See Section 3.] In [16] and [17], we proved that the process x → u3 is symmetric
w.r.t. the law π3 of the three-dimensional Bessel bridge on [0, 1], π3 is the unique

r ∈ (0, 1); see (15) below. The last term of (5) was interpreted as a boundary term
and applied to characterize η as a family of additive functionals of u3 . Finally, we
proved that x → uδ is the radial part in the sense of Dirichlet forms of the Gaussian
process Z3 , solution of the R3 -valued SPDE (3) above with δ = 3.

t ≥ 0, θ ∈ S1 := R/Z,

where α > 0, x̂ : S1 → R is continuous, inf x̂ > 0 and g satisfies suitable growth
conditions, and proved that α = 3 is the critical exponent for û to hit zero in finite
time. More precisely, the following was proved:
1. If α > 3, then a.s. û(t, θ) > 0 for all t ≥ 0, θ ∈ S1 .
2. If α < 3, then with positive probability, there exist t > 0, θ ∈ S1 , such that
û(t, θ) = 0.
It seems that the critical case α = 3 is treated here for the first time. Our result
says that the solution of (1) can possibly hit 0 in (0, 1) in a finite time, but in a
way that the nonlinearity u−3 does not blow up in L1loc ([0, ∞) × (0, 1)), so that
we have existence for all times. Notice that we do not require any strict positivity
of the initial datum: our result cover even the case of x ≡ 0.
The results presented above allow also to prove that for all continuous
x : [0, 1] → [0, ∞) with x(0) = x(1) = 0, for all α ≥ 3 and C > 0 the following

The family (uδ )δ≥3 , defined by (1) and (4), reveal several analogies with the
family of Bessel processes (ρδ )δ≥1 . Indeed, recall that:
1. If (Bt )t≥0 is a linear BM and x ≥ 0, then, for all δ > 1, there exists a unique
continuous nonnegative solution (ρδ (t, x))t≥0 of the SDE:
(8)

(9)

δ−1
dt + dB,
t ≥ 0, ρδ (0, x) = x,
2ρδ
and, for δ = 1, there exists a unique pair (ρ1 , L), with t → ρ1 (t, x) continuous
and nonnegative and t → L(t, x) continuous and monotone nondecreasing,
satisfying
dρδ =

dρ1 = dL + dB,

ρ1 (0, x) = x, L(0, x) = 0,



ρ1 dt L = 0.

For all δ ≥ 1, ρδ = (ρδ (t, x))t≥0,x≥0 is called the δ-dimensional Bessel process.
2. The process ρδ is the diffusion associated with the Dirichlet form:

dx f, g → γ (f, g) :=
f (x)g  (x)x δ−1 dx,

where ωδ := π δ/2 / (1 + δ/2).
3. If δ ∈ N ∩ [1, ∞) and (Bδ (t))t≥0 is a δ-dimensional Brownian motion, then ρδ
is characterized as the radial part in the sense of Dirichlet forms of Bδ ; that is,
the Dirichlet form γ δ , generating ρδ , is the image of
W 1,2 (Rδ )

under the map Rδ y → |y| ∈ [0, ∞). Notice that, in this case, it is even true
that the law of ρδ is equal to the law of |Bδ |.

4. For all α ≥ 1 and c > 0 there exists a unique continuous nonnegative solution
ρ of the following SDE:
c
dρ =
(10)
dt + dB,
t ≥ 0, ρ(0) ≥ 0,
(ρ)α
while for all 0 < α < 1 and c ≥ 0 there exists a unique pair (ρ, L) such that:
ρ(·) is continuous nonnegative, L(·) is continuous and monotone nondecreasing,

ρ(0) = x, L(0) = 0,

and moreover, L = 0.

In particular, in the critical case δ = 1 a boundary term appears, while for δ > 1
only a logarithmic-derivative term appears.
Notice that the exponent in the nonlinear term of (8) is equal to −1, that is, to
minus the critical dimension for (10)–(11) and (12)–(13): the same happens for the
exponent in the nonlinear term of (1), which is equal to −3, that is, to minus the
critical dimension for (6)–(7) and (2)–(5). Moreover, the maps

For a general theory of integration by parts formulae in infinite dimension,
see [9]. For integration by parts formulae and infinite-dimensional Dirichlet forms
on stationary Bessel processes, see [7]. Part of the results of this paper has been
announced in [18].
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we prove the integration by parts
formula (2). Section 3 is devoted to the study of equation (1). In Section 4 we study
equations (6) and (7).
We fix some notation: We set H := L2 (0, 1) and we denote the canonical scalar
product in H by ·, · and the associated norm by  · . We set K0 := {x ∈ H,
x ≥ 0}, O := [0, +∞) × [0, 1] and

We also denote by Cc2 (0, 1) the set of all h : [0, 1] → R, being twice continuously

we denote a two-parameter Wiener process defined on a complete probability

function
E[W (t, θ)W (t  , θ  )] = (t ∧ t  )(θ ∧ θ  ),

(t, θ), (t  , θ  ) ∈ O.

see Chapter XI of [13]. By Girsanov’s theorem, a Bessel bridge of dimension δ ≥ 2
between a and a over [0, 1] is a weak solution of (18); see XI.3.11 in [13]. Suppose
that a > 0 and that (x, B̂) is a weak solution of (18), where B̂ is a Brownian
motion. By Theorem IX.3.5 of [13], there exists a unique continuous process
(q(t))t∈[0,1] , adapted to the filtration of B̂, such that

where [δ] ∈ N and [δ] ≤ δ < [δ] + 1. By Itô’s formula, the square of the modulus
of a Brownian bridge of dimension [δ] between 0 and 0 over [0, 1] is a weak
solution of (21). By pathwise uniqueness we have uniqueness in law, so that q is
equal in law to the square of the modulus of a Brownian bridge of dimension [δ]
between 0 and 0 over [0, 1]. In particular, q(t) > 0 for all t ∈ (0, 1); see Chapter
√
XI of [13]. Then, setting x̂ := q, we have x̂ > 0 for all t ∈ (0, 1) and by Itô’s

Since x(0) ≥ 0 = x̂(0), we obtain x(t) ≥ x̂(t) for all t ∈ [0, T0 ); since x̂ > 0 on
(0, 1), then x(t) > 0 on [0, 1]. Then, we have proved that every weak solution
(x, B̂) of (18) with a > 0, satisfies x(t) > 0 for all t ∈ [0, 1].
Therefore, we can prove pathwise uniqueness for (18) if a > 0. Indeed, let
(x 1 , B̂) and (x 2 , B̂) be two weak solutions of (18) with the same driving Brownian
motion B̂. An explicit computation yields

so that x 1 ≡ x 2 . By Yamada–Watanabe’s theorem, every weak solution is a strong
solution, and for all a > 0, δ ≥ 2, we have existence of a solution xδa of (18),
adapted to the filtration of the fixed Brownian motion (B(t))t∈[0,1] ; see [15].

and since (a − a  )+ = 0, then xδa ≤ xδa . If now an ↓ 0, then we set xδ0 :=
limn xδan ≥ 0. By the above considerations, xδ0 is a strong solution of (18) with
a = 0 and xδ0 > 0 on (0, 1). In particular, xδ0 is continuous and by Dini’s theorem
xδan ↓ xδ0 uniformly on [0, 1]. Arguing like in (23) we obtain pathwise uniqueness
for a = 0 in the class of continuous (x(t))t∈[0,1] such that x > 0 on (0, 1).
Continuity of a → xδa follows analogously. If δ ∈ N, by Itô’s formula (xδ0 )2 is a
weak solution of (21). Since uniqueness in law holds for (21), then xδ0 is equal in
law to the modulus of a Brownian bridge of dimension δ between 0 and 0 over
[0, 1]. 
R EMARK 1. In the proof of Lemma 1, we proved pathwise uniqueness for (18)
with a = 0 in the class of continuous nonnegative (x(t))t∈[0,1] . Notice that if we
omit the requirement of the nonnegativity, then pathwise uniqueness does not hold
for (18) with a = 0. Indeed, notice that γ (·, ·, 0) ≡ 0. Let B̂ := −B and call x̂δ0 the
nonnegative strong solution of

obtained by Lemma 1. Then, (xδ0 , B) and (−x̂δ0 , B) are different solutions of (18),
since xδ0 > 0 and −x̂δ0 < 0 on (0, 1). This shows that also the uniqueness in
law fails for (18) if a = 0. Nevertheless, every weak solution of (18) is a strong
solution. Indeed, if (x, B) is a solution of (18) with a = 0, then either x ≡ xδ0 or
x ≡ −x̂δ0 .

P ROOF OF T HEOREM 3. We divide the proof into several steps. In steps 1–4
we prove (i) and (ii). The idea is to approximate uaδ from below, by means of
solutions vε , ε > 0, of Nualart–Pardoux-type equations. We choose vε so that its
invariant measure converges to πδa as ε ↓ 0. In step 5 we prove (iii) and in step 6
we prove (iv). We choose the realization of xδa given in Lemma 1 with a Brownian
motion B on (, F , P) independent of W .
Step 1. Uniqueness of solutions of (30) follows from the dissipativity of the
coefficients: indeed, let u1 and u2 be two nonnegative continuous solutions of (30),
and set for ε > 0, hε (θ) := [θ(1 − θ)/ε] ∧ 1, θ ∈ [0, 1] and φ := u1 − u2 . By (33),

By the proof of Theorem 4 given in [12], we obtain in particular that for all ε > 0,
vε,c ↑ vε uniformly on bounded sets of O, as c ↓ 0. By Lemma 2(a) we obtain
that ε → vε,c is nonincreasing for all c > 0 and, letting c ↓ 0, that ε → vε is
nonincreasing. Notice that wε,c := ε + vε,c is solution of

We obtain that ε → ε + vε is nondecreasing and therefore vε converges uniformly
on O as ε ↓ 0 to a continuous function which we denote by uaδ . We set for all
ε, c > 0: Yε,c (t, x) := vε,c (t, ·), Yε (t, x) := vε (t, ·), Xδa (t, x) := uaδ (t, ·), t ≥ 0.
We shall prove that the process Xδa enjoys the desired properties. The proof
will be based only on monotonicity arguments, on the integration by parts formula
w.r.t. πδa (16) and on the explicit knowledge of the invariant measure of Yε , given
by Theorem 5.
Step 3. We have for all t ≥ 0, x, x  ∈ K0 ∩ Ca :

Since Yε (t, ·) and Xδa (t, ·) are a.s. 1-Lipschitz continuous in the norm of H , they
can be continuously extended to processes in K0 . We still denote the extensions,
respectively, by Yε and Xδa .
Let a > 0. By Theorem 5, the process Yε is symmetric with respect to the
probability measure γε dπ3a /Zε ; that is,

E ψ(xδa )ϕ Xδa (t, xδa ) = E ψ Xδa (t, xδa ) ϕ(xδa ) ,

that is, Xδa is symmetric w.r.t. πδa for a > 0. By Lemma 2(b), a → Xδa is monotone,
and by the uniqueness of solutions of (30), a.s. Xδa (t, x) ↓ Xδ0 (t, x) uniformly as
a ↓ 0. By (37) and the continuity of a → xδa , we can let a ↓ 0 in (38) and obtain
that Xδ0 is symmetric w.r.t. πδ0 .
Now let a ≥ 0 and m1 and m2 be invariant probability measures for Xδa . If q1
and q2 are random variable with law, respectively, m1 and m2 , and independent
of W , by (37) we have, for all ϕ ∈ Cb (H ),

|m1 (ϕ) − m2 (ϕ)| = E ϕ Xδa (t, q1 ) − ϕ Xδa (t, q2 )  → 0

Therefore, πδa is the unique invariant probability measure of Xδa . Finally, we
notice that vε,c satisfies a white-noise driven SPDE with dissipative nonlinearity
of Nemytskii type. By Proposition 4.4.4 of [2], we have, for all bounded and Borel

Therefore, (D δ,a , Lip(H )) is closable in L2 (πδa ), and the unique continuous
extension of (Rδa (λ))λ>0 to L2 (πδa ) is the strongly continuous resolvent associated
with the closure (D δ,a , W 1,2 (πδa )): see the proof of Theorem 5 in [17] for details.
Step 6. We prove (iv). Let δ ∈ N ∩ [4, ∞) and a = 0. By the last assertion
in Lemma 1, the image measure of µδ under δ is πδ . Therefore there exists
a measurable set 0 ⊆ H δ with µδ (0 ) = 1, such that for all y ∈ 0 , |y| > 0
on (0, 1), so that for all h ∈ C0 (0, 1) the following map is well defined:

exists a sequence {Gn } ⊂ Cb1 (H δ ), such that

and by the density of Lip(H ) in W 1,2 (πδ ), we have that for every ϕ ∈ W 1,2 (πδ ),
ϕ ◦ δ ∈ W 1,2 (µδ ) and (41) holds for all ϕ, ψ ∈ W 1,2 (πδ ). It remains to prove that
if ϕ ∈ L2 (πδ ) satisfies ϕ ◦ δ ∈ W 1,2 (µδ ), then ϕ ∈ W 1,2 (πδ ). It is enough to prove
that {[Rδ0 (1)ψ] ◦ δ : ψ ∈ Lip(H )} is dense in {ϕ ◦ δ : ϕ ∈ L2 (πδ )} ∩ W 1,2 (µδ )
w.r.t. δ1 .
By (41), Yδ := {ϕ ◦ δ : ϕ ∈ W 1,2 (πδ )} is a closed subspace of W 1,2 (µδ ).
Therefore, setting δ1 := (·, ·)L2 (µδ ) + δ , for all G ∈ W 1,2 (µδ ) there exists a
unique δ G ∈ W 1,2 (πδ ), such that for all ϕ ∈ W 1,2 (πδ ),

where D1δ := (·, ·)L2 (πδ ) + D δ . Moreover, δ is Markovian; that is, G ≥ 0 implies

R EMARK 5. The construction of solutions of (30) in the proof of Theorem 3
uses pathwise methods, and the identification of Xδa as the Markov process
associated with the Dirichlet form D δ,a is obtained a posteriori. One can follow
another approach, constructing a Markov process properly associated with D δ,a ,
and then proving, by the integration by parts formula (16) and by Fukushima’s
decomposition, that the process solves (30). However this approach gives only
weak solutions and requires the proof of quasiregularity of D δ,a ; see [8]. On
the other hand, the pathwise approach followed here gives existence of strong
solutions of (30), that is, adapted to the filtration of the driving noise, and gives
also the quasiregularity of D δ,a by Theorem IV.5.1 in [8].

P ROOF. Let fˆ : (0, ∞) → R, smooth and monotone nondecreasing, possibly
unbounded in a neighbourhood of 0. We claim that there exists a unique pair (û, η̂),
solution of the Nualart–Pardoux equation (35) with f = fˆ, such that hfˆ(û) ∈
L1 ([0, T ] × [0, 1]) for all h ∈ Cc2 (0, 1) and T ≥ 0. Indeed, if we set, for ε > 0,
(ûε , η̂ε ) as the solution of the Nualart–Pardoux (35) with f = fˆ(· + ε), then,
arguing as in step 2 of Proof of Theorem 3, we have that ε → ûε is monotone
nonincreasing and ε → ε + ûε is monotone nondecreasing. Moreover, ε → η̂ε is
monotone nondecreasing. Therefore, ûε converges uniformly on bounded subsets
of O to a continuous function û and η̂ε converges distributionally to a measure η̂,
and by Beppo–Levi’s theorem, (û, η̂) is the wanted solution. Uniqueness follows
from Proof of Theorem 4, given in [12].
Therefore, for all α ≥ 0 and C ≥ 0, there exists a unique pair (û, η̂), solution of
the SPDE with reflection (35) with f (θ, y) = −Cy −α , y > 0. If α = 3 and C > 0,
then we proved in Theorem 3 that η̂ ≡ 0.

For all α ∈ (0, 3), e−2Fα is in L1 (π3a ) and not identically equal to 0. Therefore
(η̂)x∈K0 ∩Ca is not identically 0. 
