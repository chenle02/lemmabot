How to make sense of SHE for delta initial condition

## Assistant: 
To make sense of the Stochastic Heat Equation (SHE) for delta initial condition, one needs to consider the formulation of the SHE with measure-valued initial data. In the provided context, the SHE is studied with rough initial conditions and various boundary conditions [1]. The initial data is considered in the form of a measure, such as the Dirac delta function [8].

For the SHE with delta initial condition, one can follow these steps:
1. Define the SHE with measure-valued initial data, where the measure is the Dirac delta function centered at a specific point.
2. Establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the SHE with the delta initial condition.
3. Analyze the behavior of solutions, such as moment estimates, blow-up properties, or global boundedness, depending on the specific parameters and conditions of the SHE model [3], [8].

By following these steps and considering the relevant results and conditions provided in the context, one can rigorously define and study the Stochastic Heat Equation with a delta Dirac initial condition.
